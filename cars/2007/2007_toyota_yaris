<TEXT>I really appreciate the maneuverability of this car. (It's great for parking.) It's fun on curves and stable on the highway. I haven't had any bad experiences with wind gusts, etc. It's not a sports car, and I'm fine with that. The reliability and economic fuel consumption are what I was after. I couldn't be happier.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>On the two-door hatchback the doors are large, which makes for easy ingress and egress. The center-mounted display is not big deal and makes room for another glove box. You sit higher that in most two-doors, so your visibility is better.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my '07 Yaris for just over 3 years now and I must say it has to be one of the best cars I've owned!! Not only does it get around 27 mpg around town, but the maintenance costs are very small. The only maintenance I put in were oil changes, new set of tires at 40k, new air filter, and new front window blades in order to pass last inspection. So far, the car hasn't given me any problems and is truly fun to drive. It has enough pick-up and handles well in all weather conditions. I highly recommend this vehicle if you are on a budget like I am. I feel that the Toyota Yaris is perfect given what I paid for it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I fell in love with the MP3 aux input and the positioning of the cup holders. That by itself is the tipping point of what sells a car!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Brought it used in June. My grandkids were with me and we named it Baby Blue. It's a great little car. Went on a 1300 mile trip to California. Baby blue performed great. Went up mountains with no trouble; A/C was great. Seats are very comfortable. It drives like a bigger car. Lots of room for luggage. The radio was best of all the small cars I have owned. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I average 32mpg in city per tank, 40mpg pure highway driving. Ample storage. Enough power to get you moving. Throttle response varies from 0.2 sec (noticeable, but on par with other DBW cars) to well OVER a second on warm days (omg what is wrong w/ my car). Variable means you can't adapt to it because it changes. This causes premature clutch wear because rev-matching for downshifts cannot be done reliably. Toyota will not warranty clutch repair no matter how few miles. Mine is still holding on, but it has developed a shudder at 20k miles... it's just a matter of time. No tach available on the manual hatchback. I'm on my 3rd factory MP3 stereo.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Above all other niceties the mpg- factor is tops by far. After six round trips from Florida to NJ and one 4,500- mile trip to NE, the average highway mph is much better than advertised: 44 mph on mostly interstate driving, using regular (10% ethane) 85 octane gasoline, air conditioning on constantly. Local efficiency is steady at 33/34 mpg. Long distance driving is comfortable, surprisingly large baggage room. However, the center mounted instrument panel is irritating now as is was the first day I drove this otherwise wonderful little car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great little car. We get 39mpg with this one. Very roomy interior, more so than the Corolla we traded in. No problems encountered, has enough power accessories too and the ipod plug to keep the teenagers happy with the car. Can't find anything wrong, priced right for quality!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! Had it for over 2 years with no troubles. Routine oil changes are only required every 5000 miles instead of the usual 3000. My tires will need replacing soon (currently have 37000 miles on them.) I love that it's a small car, yet the seats feel more like that of a van in that you sit straight up instead of the laid back/stretched out position of many cars. And I haven't found anything that doesn't fit in the back when the seat is folded down. The back seat is very roomy for a two-door car. You don't hit your head on the ceiling and enough leg room for an average person. Great gas mileage, although I've never gotten what other people have reported (I get 33-36 mpg).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seat positions, great mpg, awesome storage capacity, great buying price, I can park anywhere! 7 cup holders and 3 glove compartments.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I rear-ended another vehicle that left a dent on their bumper and did $3500 damage to my Yaris! Why so fragile? And the airbag didn't even go off. I love the car. I put the back seat down and use the hatchback/space like it's a pickup truck for building and garden supplies, etc. It's amazing what you can get in that little car. My manual transmission and reasonable driving practices result in >40 mpg IN TOWN! I love this car, I just wish it weren't so fragile.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seven (7) cupholders! Yay! Roomy back seat. Great handling. Cute and gets lots of questions/comments from others.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm in college... and the last thing I wanted to have to worry about was my car. So I decided to go with a toyota - having to be on a budget the Yaris was definitely in my price range. Immediately I fell in love with the car, it looked cool, had an ipod jack built in, power everything, and finally I got to the gas station. 20 bucks filled her up, what a buy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Since i purchased my 2007 Yaris in August i immediately fell in love with the gas mileage, average of 35 city and as much as 48 hwy. But i found that on option was unavaible for a keyless remote which i really miss. The 12v outlet in the console needs to be redesigned because the cover will not stay closed. I also found that you cannot roll the windows down in the rear without getting a head splitting noise. When you are used to riding with the rear windows down when it is not hot enough for the air conditioner this is a disappointment. I am a large guy and the interior room is great, seats are good and good leg room.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are great as well as the leg and head room. Fuel mileage is great averaging 35 to 48. I got the one with abs brakes and have had no problems stopping. The 1.5 engine is great for my needs with plenty of pep. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the car about a year now and the love affair continues. Got the 2 door hatchback. I still cannot believe that Toyota could put this style, comfort and reliability together at this price range. Every day it's vroom when I start the engine, I actually feel like I am driving a much bigger car or even an suv when I am behind the wheel, great visibility and have been averaging about 38 miles per gallon. It is peppy as hell and my wife says it is cute. Highly recommend to all who want great dependability, great gas mileage and "cute" style at a great price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched about 15 cars in this segment. The only thing that motivated me to purchase the Yaris was the promise of no scheduled maintenance for the first 120,000 miles. That was the deciding factor. EPA ratings are off, I average low 30s in town and mid 30s on the highway. The brakes are terrible. It struggles to take turns. The electric steering (at highway speeds) is frightening. My S didn't even come with a remote key fob. Be careful driving the S on a windy day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The driver's seat (for me) was the best feature - I'm 6'1" and couldn't find a better seat for me in this class range. Next to that I am (personally) amazed this is a 1.5 liter engine - it does just fine staying with traffic which I really appreciate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Awesome ride for a small car. Comfort is quite nice. It did take some time to get used to the controls being in the center of console. The mileage is second to none... 30s in the city and near 40 mpg on the highway. For the price, it is an awesome buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is priced reasonably, so you can't put too high of expectations on it. Its engine power is adequate, though not impressive. Road noise is quite high. So is the engine noise. It seems to be well-built, though we had a plastic engine compartment cover fall off of the bottom of the vehicle a few months after we got it. The snow level was fairly high, and since the car sits low, the snow probably pulled it off. I'd consider it a design flaw. The Toyota technician said it was a common problem, but refused to replace it under warranty. The MPG isn't what it was originally rated. We have managed to get 40 mpg, but usually get about 30 (some highway, some city) </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall it's nice that it gets great gas mileage and is a smooth drive. However, the body is not safe in an accident. At 3 mph I hit a truck and my car was very badly messed up (from hitting something at 3 MPH!!). I don't think this is a very safe car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Initially, I looked at the '05-'07 Toyota Corollas, but once I test drove the Yaris, I was impressed by the sporty and comfortable driving experience. In my search for this car, I read posts from other owners, and now I am happy to add my very favorable opinion on this car. The purchase of this car is one of my best spending decisions, and likely to be yours once you decide on the model (sport/standard), color and transmission (auto/manual). Overall, it was the multiple tests drives of this car that convinced me to buy a new Yaris instead of the used Corolla.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I absolutely love the driver's side glove box right above the steering wheel. No more stretching over to the passenger's side for a pen/paper, lipstick, lotion, etc. It's all right there within reach. The other thing I really like is the 60/40 split rear seat. This comes in the power pkg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had mine for 6 months, and it's a great car. Easy to drive, and sits high enough in the interior so I don't feel like I'm driving a small car. I've taken it on one long distance trip, and it was very comfortable for 4 people. I'm averaging about 33 MPG commuting in the city. Lots of fun to drive, and parking is a breeze. People constantly stop to check it out, and I've been surprised at the amount of cargo it can hold with the fold-down seats. I traded in my Camry for the Yaris, and don't regret it for a second. It's simply a fun little car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Several people hate the cup holders, but I love them. The placement in front of the air vents actually keeps my drink cool! Might be a problem for coffee, though. The gas mileage and seat height are great, absorbs road bumps with ease. Lots of storage for such a small car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love our Yaris! It consistently gets between 37-42 mpg. It is comfortable on long trips and has plenty of zip going up and down hills and for passing. Both of us are tall and have plenty of space inside with the automatic transmission. Back-seat passengers are surprised with the comfort and leg room. With the hatchback, we're able to carry large items with no difficulty. Our Yaris is our favorite all-time car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle for people who want to have a solid commuter which does not cost them money. I do drive a lot on the highway and I also do drive the speed limits and accelerate at a modest rate, but any driver can achieve great fuel mileage on this car. After 5000 miles, I'm averaging over 44 MPG. I use the air conditioner whenever it's warm. The Yaris is made for economical driving and is not meant to substitute for a sporty car. For the price, you get a little more than you pay for if legendary Toyota reliability is present and I'll know that in a couple hundred thousand miles. I highly recommend this car for responsible people who keep a budget and are environmentally aware.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel efficiency is my favorite feature, but exterior design is a close second. The seats are more comfortable for long trips than any BMW, Honda or Toyota truck I've owned.</FAVORITE>

This car allows me to be able to travel to both of these places economically. I get 40 plus miles per gallon on the high way and 30 plus in town. It also has plenty of power to get me up the hills.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have S 4 door manual, blue. Added sun roof and leather seats - nice look! It gets me consistently 34-35 mpg. I do a lot of stop/go (driving in San Francisco) and also highway driving. The car looks awesome with the blue color, like a sports car. You can get nice torque with the stickshift but it's a very delicate stick and not easy to shift smoothly. I like the driving style, easy to handle, factory tires and breaks are good. The body quality is my main problem with it. I had a 2001 V6 Maxima before which had much higher quality interior and exterior, body was tough. Besides the cheap body, it's also very light. A big car accident would obliterate it, I think. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The MPG is consistent at 34-35, even if I drive it a bit rougher with the stick. Blue color makes it look like sports car, awesome. MP3 plug-in. Zippy. Good trunk space. Spacious back seats in 4DR (2DR is too tight for someone over 5'6, imo). I think price is decent for what you get.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The placement of the a/c condenser, close to the ground, and very little protection from the grille can cause foreign objects to damage the condenser, especially small rocks. A very small rock penetrated through the grill and damaged the condenser causing a micro hole depressurizing the a/c system. The a/c no longer works. I took it to a Toyota dealer even though it is under warranty I still had to pay $80.00 for them to look at it because the damage was caused by an outside object and was not covered. The bill to repair it was $1200.00. Toyota should have put wire mesh in that area of the grille to protect the condenser. Positives are gas mileage and price, but you get what you pay for</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a Toyota customer since 1983 and most recently owned a 2000 Camry until it was totaled in an accident. I wanted another Toyota and was looking for better gas mileage than my 25 mpg Camry. I have 3,000 miles on it now and havn't gotten better than 28 mpg. I am so disappointed that I am thinking of getting rid of it and buying another Camry. My driving habits haven't changed and it only gets 3 mpg better than my bigger 2000 Camry. Not happy!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Yaris has the looks and then some. For 106 hp, this car has pick up. I have gone 100 mph on it, and it feels very stable (except when there's a lot of wind the car feels like it's floating and not on the ground). Do not be scared to drive it on the highways. I have gone on multiple road trips with it and it is so much fun, especially driving through windy roads. I could not imagine driving any other car on highway 1 (of course except a Ferrari). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tight turns, great handling - super nimble - great for lane changes, passing and merging, awesome sound system with iPod hookup, and let's not forget... 40 MPG!! My last full tank cost me less than 30 bucks - now how many people can say that?</FAVORITE>

My first fill up and I was amazed at the 42 mpg. I have been getting 42 mpg consistently rain or shine. At 4500 miles it isn't even broken in, so I expect 44 mpg or so once it is broken in.

<TEXT>I like small cars and a hatchback is my favorite body style. Having done some online research and discovering that this vehicle had the same drive train as the Scion xA and xB and the same engine as the Prius, I was intrigued. I hunted one down online that was totally devoid of the overpriced options. Having previously owned a Geo Metro I was a bit apprehensive about the acceleration and hill climbing ability of an ultra high mileage car. I took it for a test drive and was I ever surprised! It accelerated and handled like a small sports car, while at the same time having an interior that was roomy with comfortable seats. It was a frugal sports car lovers dream. I bought it the next day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car has a very stiff undercarriage for a small car and also has amazingly precise electric power steering. The acceleration is very good if you know how to safely wind out a 5 speed. I'm getting about 35mpg around town with the ac on and almost 40 mpg on the open road with no ac on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First, let's be clear. I'm a satisficer, not a maximizer. All cars are compromises, and this is expecially true at the lower end of the price spectrum. I'm 6'2" and, ahem, let's just say over 300 pounds at the present time. I can get in and out of this car with no problem. It runs like a charm, turns on a dime, the steering and braking are silky smooth and I've still got a quarter of a tank left with the odometer at 325+ miles, so I'm heading for 40+ mpg on the first tank. Yes, the seats could be better, maybe Toyota will fix them, maybe not. The cup holders are neat - you can send the air around them - or use the AC to cool your drink. Nothing's perfect, but the Yaris is awfully good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice big doors, easy entrance/exit for tall people + excellent visibility when driving. Wonderful almost magical turning radius makes parking in crowded parking lots almost fun. Lots of places to stash assorted stuff. Handles speed humps with aplomb.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was what I was looking for. Good looks, good mileage, Toyota is its name. The 1989 Civic hatchback almost made it to 300k and you will certainly hear about it if this doesn't. I got a great basic car. No radio, 14" wheels, roll up windows, exactly like I am used to. I threw in an aftermarket Pioneer 6900ub with direct usb link to the iPod and I have a great commuter, even for those times when I have to sit in Seattle area traffic. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Yaris Liftback is the first car I've owned (5th total) that I truly LOVE. It looks small, compact, and stylin' from the outside, yet it's literally HUGE on the inside. None of my passengers can believe how much room there is until they've sat in it. The steering is silky smooth and responsive, the engine is surprisingly good for something quite small, and the interior design is amazing. Toyota did an amazing job with this design. It's main use for me is city life/city driving (5 people fit no problem), but we've also taken it on road trips and it's been very nice (for 2 people) as the back seat folds down for a ton of added trunk space. I've been getting almost 40 mpg on the highway. A+ !</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Thoughtful interior layout makes it easy to keep things tidy. Oodles of small compartments (3 glove boxes!). Smooth steering and turn radius. MP3 player aux jack (with perfect size partition for my cased-in iPod to sit in right next to it). SEVEN cup holders. Top notch air-conditioner that cools FAST.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Yaris Liftback after selling a new 2007 VW Rabbit which was not a good fit for me. The Yaris is everything the Rabbit is not: fun, light, thrifty, nimble, and solidly built. I'm 50, and I grew up driving basic cars so the simple nature of the Yaris really appeals to me. Great visibility, light and intuitive controls, roomy (I'm 6'5" & 175 lbs), practical, and very frugal with fuel. So far, I'm a very happy new owner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive the 3 door hatchback and it's the cutest little car ever, cuter than the Volkswagen buggy, Minicooper, etc. People always comment about how adorable my car is. I'm always happy at the pump because it only costs me about 30-35 dollars to fill up the tank, and it lasts about 1.5-2 weeks. It's roomy, comfortable, and reliable! :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a wonderful car for the price. At about 13,000 you can't expect much. The Yaris is like a a good $5 hamburger, it's good, but it's not a filet mignon. For the price, I feel this is the best car out there. I did a lot of shopping before buying and am very pleased with it. For a while I was a little iffy, but then I got the windows tinted and it looks way better, especially since I got a dark blue color. Dark cars need dark windows. This was my first car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great mileage. I average about 30 mpg zipping around town which is only 4 under the EPA. I haven't had much time to test it on the highway. Looks, I like that it looks like a Camry. Speedometer. You definitely get used to it, and miss it when you drive a different car. It's a Toyota. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Yaris for a week now! I got into a car accident so was forced to get rid of my Saturn Ion. I love the Yaris. The mileage is much better, it runs smooth. I have broken 100 in this car and it never felt faster than 50. The turning radius is wonderful. I opted for the leather interior. I drive over 100 miles a day to and from work so this car is wonderful with gas prices soaring. The only thing I dislike is the cup holders but I do like the extra ones in the doors.

<TEXT>I love this car. It is very affordable and great on gas. I have two kids who have plenty of room in the back seat. The stereo system is excellent and it's wired to plug your MP3 player right in. Also like having lots of cup holders and bottle holders (6 total). Had to get used to speedometer in the middle of the dashboard, but it's great for back seat drivers. :) The body style is adorable and easy to fit into small spaces. The only thing I don't like about this car is that the acceleration is not as quick as I'm used to, but it's not TOO bad. I am very happy with this purchase and would definitely buy another Yaris. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a Yaris and Scion 5 months ago. Loved the cars. My Scion got totalled by someone not paying attention 3 weeks ago - the car did great at keeping me safe, just bruising where the seat belt and air bag got me. I went right out and purchased a Yaris like my husband's as the Scion wasn't available in the color I wanted. The Yaris is fantastic. Gets great gas mileage, easy to see out of to reverse, great acceleration. I'd recommend it to anyone willing to listen. Thanks Toyota! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had Yaris for 1900 miles or 2 1/2 weeks. Trip to Maine and 103 miles per day work. Its ride is very good for its size. Handles on highway much better than I thought, hugs the road and can change lane in a flash when needed. Gas mileage is way better than EPA states. I have averaged 42 plus miles per gallon since first day. 42 the lowest going to Maine averaged 78 MPH A/C on and I got 42.18 MPG. Best so far 43.50 MPG. That is combination city and highway. I don't race or see if I can beat everyone to the stop sign or light. I get there 1/2 second later and about $3.00 cheaper. If you want a car that is great on MPG then Yaris can not be beat for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the type of car I expected from VW - compact, highly efficient, well made, and innovative. Well, I had to go to Toyota to get it, but at least there are a ton of Toyota dealers to get it serviced at! :-) I gave up some creature comforts that I hardly miss - like power windows etc. - but got a great price. This puppy accelerates FAST with a 5 speed. It is more sporty than my old VW Golf! At the same time I am getting 35-37 mpg during this break-in period on my freeway commute. Quiet when cruising. Engine noise when accelerating, but that's the trade off for a sub-2500 pound car that does well in NHTSA, NCAP, and IIHS crash tests. I'm a happy new owner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car a little over a month ago, and have really enjoyed it. It's my first new car, so I've been really careful during the "break in" process. I can tell it has gotten smoother during this time. The steering is awesome! I also have come to really like the center console design. It's easy to use and find all the controls. Sometimes I wish there were a tachometer, but it's not a big deal. This is a great car for anyone who just wants a buzz-around car! It does great on the highway as well, although it has a harder time accelerating on hills (and with more than 2 adults in the car). But I still love it for what it is!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really do love my Yaris. I was a bit skeptical after reading some reviews from various editors, but in the end I decided to trust the consumer reviews, and I'm glad I did. As long as you understand that you are not going to have the fastest car in the world, I think you will be pleased if you purchase a Yaris. I have a light touch on the pedal to conserve my MPG, but it has no problem traveling in the fast lane. I have never driven a hatchback, but now I am hooked forever! Some reviews talk about a lack of a fun factor, but trust me, it's a lot more fun than handling a big truck or SUV. It's a great feeling to fill up my tank and know it's going to last me the week! That alone is worth it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive mostly in the city, and I usually get around 36 mpg with the automatic transmission. The handling is adequate for the car, but it could be a bit better. The interior is nicley finished, but it would be better if the speedometer, etc., were in front of the driver by the steering wheel instead of to the side. The seats are pretty comfortable and there is plenty of room in the rear seats and in the trunk. It took me a while to find the ABS that I wanted though. Adding a turbocharged engine could help up performance while pushing fuel consumption even lower and improving performance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted the Rabbit as I have always had a GTI and couldn't afford the new ones. I mosey into the Toyota dealership and see the Yaris and wasn't convinced at first until I drove it. It's a little slow off the gun, but once you get into the mid-range, she has some go. It's the most fun car I've driven and it's more comfortable than the Mini. I got the convenience package which is good, but plan on getting all the TRD accessories. Gas mileage is great, which was my primary motivation for the car, but I never expected it to be so fun to drive. Got the Blazing Blue and plan on making it look like the commercial.

The steering wheel is a little cheesy looking. I got every option offered and so far so good. Don't like that there is no place to put change or your cell phone or that the cup holders when you put a cup in them block the A/C vent. That won't work when it is 95 degrees outside. The outside of the car I love. As for acceleration, I have a manual so it has done pretty good. I drive on a major highway to work and it keeps up with all the other cars at 80 mph. Plus it's a Toyota so it is going to last.</TEXT>

I have the same complaints as my first review. I have to agree that the seats are not as comfortable as I'd like on long trips. They might break in though after a while.

<TEXT>I expected the great gas mileage (I'm getting 35 pretty routinely and 38-40 on long trips), but the advertising doesn't tell you how much fun it is to drive! You sit up high - feels a little like an SUV in this regard - so road visibility is great. This thing turns on a dime, so you can zip in and out of really tight spots. Mine is a standard (5 sp) transmission, so pickup (even with the AC running) is a non-issue. Good passenger room (I have the 4-door.) Safety issue: there is a HUGE blind spot between the rt. rear passenger window and the back window - you really MUST use the passenger-side mirror to see what's coming up behind you on the rt. side.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had an Accord for a while, but rising gas prices ($3.50 at the time) pushed me towards a more economical car. I settled on the Yaris for the fuel efficiency and cost; I get around 37 mpg on average, mostly highway driving (35 mile commute each way to work). It is a very basic vehicle, but it suits my needs just fine. I opted for the MP3/CD player which was well worth it. The AUX jack in the center console is very useful, but the placement (right below the shifter) is a little awkward. The car looks quite small on the inside, but my friends comment on how much room there is on the inside (more than they expected, at least).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a Toyota Yaris hatchback and I loved it. I don't think there is a better value on the market. I am 6'5 and the car was very comfortable and could handle 3 passengers just fine (the car is way roomier than it looks). Gas mileage is fantastic (consistently 34+ mpg) and the cost-to-own is the lowest you're going to get. It won't set any speed records but I found that the car could easily get up to good freeway speeds and was fun to drive. I love the distinctive look. I got a lot of appreciative looks and positive comments. Also, I was impressed by how well the car absorbed the impact of a high speed collision. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a nice looking car, it looks somehow like a sports car. But don?t get misled. The Yaris driving is less inspired than many others. Driving position is simply wrong: the steering is too far for taller drivers compared with any other car on the market, therefore driving pleasure and feeling are much reduced. Good front visibility but dangerous blind spots on the sides. Excellent build quality, however the paint chips easily. Very poor clutch conception, hard to engage smoothly or quickly, automatic transmission it?s a must for this car. Gas mileage is less than expected, especially in city driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We picked up our Yaris under a week ago so this is definitely a first impression, but I'll keep you updated. Although very small there is generous room inside and a surprising amount of rear leg room. Several people sat in the driver's seat and one 6'2 would have a difficult time driving the car. The center mounted speedometer took all of 10 minutes to adjust to. We put 240 miles on a trip this weekend, very little highway, and used half a tank of gas. Based on the tank size it calculates out to 42.2 MPG. Probably 40 mpg is more reasonable. Exterior is black metalflake - very nice paint. I would recommend this car to anyone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Performance: The Yaris gives you the feeling that you are in a golf cart and keeping up with normal/slow traffic is tough, with 106 hp, you will not pass anyone who dosent slow down for you! Comfort: Compromised by the fact that seating 5 people will make it all but impossible to get up to the speed limit before the next stop. Ride: Smooth but the driver's seat sits awkward if you're tall because of where the steering wheel is mounted due to the cramped interior. Fuel: I haven't been able to get more than 389 miles out of a full tank which is 34.5 miles a gallon when averaging between city and highway. Good fuel economy but the 1998 Corolla got almost as good about 2 miles less a gallon + 140hp.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the car but the seats are a problem. My wife and I never had back pain until we purchased this Yaris. But I like it enough to try to change the seats. This is an expensive proposition with minimal out of market options. I'll probably have to sell the car to save my back. However, driving the Yaris is fun and above expectations considering the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got my new Olive Mist 4dr Yaris. I just got to 200 miles and have no complaints, it is the cutest thing, people think it's a Volkswagen. Since having this I wouldn't trade it for anything; it has great pickup and turning corners is a blast. I like the cupholders where they are, it's kinda different. Gas is also GREAT, like I said, made it to 200 miles and still have over half a tank left! Get one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The unique design, affordability, I've never had a car with power anything (doors, windows) and they're great! The aux jack could be on the driver side but I'm just happy there's one to begin with!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My experience in the 2007 Yaris is great. I love my new car. It is a stylish, comfortable, and affordable vehicle. It drives smooth which makes it fun to drive. If anyone ask me how does it feel to drive a Yaris, I will tell them it feels great. I would recommend anyone who wants a car that's afordable and comfortable to buy a Yaris.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a freeway/open road driver from a more rural area. Seldom (to never) are we in a rush hour crawl. The Yaris posts near hybrid fuel efficiency with out the hybrid's price tag. Power windows, locks and cruise control and fairly good CD sound along with power steering and A/C make this economy model more pleasurable than the economy models of 3 and 4 years ago. I am six-three 230 lbs and enjoy riding in and driving this car. My family has four Toyotas and I do not fit in my daughter's Corolla. The Yaris is a different story: it has better interior room.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>By putting the Yaris in service I've reduced my greenhouse gas emissions by 55% over my previous ride. I am not "saving the environment" by any means but I might be destroying it at a significantly slower pace. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After buying old cars that I can fix my own, (old VW,and fords) until major jobs (transmission, etc.), I have gotten tired and bought this car. The first thing I looked for was fuel consumption. I wanted a hybrid, but at my federal wages it was out of my sight. Then I found 07 yaris 2 dr, 5sp M. It has the feel of my old bug, but more room for storage, great fuel consumtion and great price range.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I finally got the car with additional antilock brakes and curtain side air bag for added safety. Got 17 inch after market rims with wider tires for additional traction and stability.

<TEXT>The Yaris is a great car and economical in so many ways. If you are looking for a reliable car that is cheap on the gas then go for the Yaris. I preferred the 4 door to the Liftback version but it was still hard to decide which one to buy. I read some reviews out there about how the car lacks some things, but it is what it is. The small engine might put you off, but don't let it. It can really keep pace and does great on the highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For a little car it has just enough low end acceleration and handles tight. I bought it strictly for the mileage it gets expecting a cheap chunk of plastic. However, it was anything but.

<TEXT>I love my car. I was driving an 04 Jeep Wrangler and getting about 15 mpg because of the 6 cyl and AWD. I went to Toyota and test drove the car I was destined to buy. I was out the door with the keys in my hand about 4 hours later. Have had it over a month, and LOVE it. Great fuel economy (about $23.00 to fill up) and a tank lasts about a week. Awesome car to zip all over town in, comfortable and handles well. Roomy enough on the inside considering the size. I would definitely recommend the Yaris to anyone looking for a fuel-efficient, comfortable, and stylish ride!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car gets excellent gas mileage, is fun to drive, sharp looking, and inexpensive even with some options. One very nice option is the MP3 player port, which was my excuse for a new iPod. Most surprising is the spaciousness of this car. For how small it is, it is very roomy, especially in the back. I was very surprised by that. This is my first Toyota, and it won't be my last. I can only say one bad thing about this car, but even it is typical of cars today anyway... it has rattling issues. This is mostly just because of all the plastic used on cars now. It's just something you will have to put up with no matter what kind of car you drive. </TEXT>

Other benefits are the price, and the fact that it is relatively environmentally friendly and will help weaken our dependence on oil :0)</TEXT>

I love everything about the car except two things. Be careful when it is very windy because it will blow you around like a leaf in the fall. Second, I still have not gotten the gas mileage I am supposed to be getting. I am only getting 33 mpg on a good fill up. It should be between 34-40.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Saw a Yaris sedan drive by and was impressed with the styling. When I found out it was a Toyota and very reasonably priced I had to test drive. Hard to get but the dealer ordered in a sedan, auto, Flint Mica, and the 'B' package. In Canada that gets you ABS, EBD, A/C, power doors, windows, locks mirrors, and keyless entry, a$2000 CAD or about $1600 US. Great little car that doesn't look or feel little at all. Looks more expensive than my dad's Corolla and better equipped for less money. You do get use to the centre speedometer and tach (standard in Canada) but I hate where the cupholders are and I need a centre armrest that is not behind my arm. Still,overall it's a great car, buy one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>External styling, Flint Mica colour. Charcoal grey interior, fit and finish. Feels bigger and more expensive than it is. No one thinks it's an econobox when they see it and it's a Toyota. Solid ride, competent, no sports feel but around competent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While the size and design were hurdles in choosing it, the Yaris has proved me wrong. Quick, capable, and incredibly fuel efficient, the car has won me over. Even my tall (6'8") friend was able to fit comfortably in the front seat on a long drive. The back seat is roomier than one might expect, and there are plenty of compartments to hold things. Definitely a good car to consider, if you don't carry a lot of people/goods on a general basis. Excellent commuter car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Granted, I have owned this car for less than a week, but after a decently long trip for the holidays I feel I can give some helpful insight. For me the performance has been very acceptable. For a 1.5 liter engine it is peppy, quiet and smooth. The layout of the interior is not that quirky, but I do admit I like the sedan's interior better than the hatchback I tested - seems to be higher quality. The sound system is excellent and this is with the standard single CD AM/FM stereo. I got 40 mpg on my trip and think my opinion of this car will only get better with the miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was extremely excited to buy this car to replace my old Geo Metro. Although no fuel-driven car (and even many hybrids) comes close to Geo Metro's fuel efficiency, Yaris' record was good enough. Plus, I was looking to stay within the sub-compact category. I love it in every way except for two serious design flaws: 1. There's only ONE cup holder in the whole car, and it's positioned in a way that is utterly inconvenient. I have to reach quite far back, past the manual brake to be able to grab it. 2. If I adjust the seat so that I am comfortable reaching the pedals, I have to stretch my arms to reach the steering wheel. It makes it for a much less comfortable drive than I'd like to.</TEXT>

I will not remark on its reliability except to say that it has 26000 miles on it so far and no reported maintenance other than tire repair and replacement. It is a great economy car, perhaps the best, when considering cost of maintenance, cost to drive, looks, ease of operation, and the fact that it is a Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't recall the last time I found myself looking forward to driving; my Yaris makes my being on the road a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I can only echo others' comments regarding the Yaris' handling, fuel economy (I've been averaging 34 MPG as a city driver) and its inescapable head-turning likeability. I adapted quickly to the center-mounted instrument panel. Variety is the spice! I definitely recommend the Power Package if only for the power-lock amenity. The standard stereo setup that's included in this package is robust enough for me. Friends have all commented on the Yaris' deceptively roomy interior. It seats five, but four seems a more realistic number to expect. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love, love, love having an MP3-capable CD player. The sharp turning range is incredible. I'm able to wiggle in and out of tight parking spots very easily.

<TEXT>I love my Yaris! It is metallic blue on the outside and has a black interior with metallic blue dots. Although it looks small, the Yaris hatchback is very roomy in the front and in the back seats. The Yaris is very convenient with its 20 compartments, 7 different cupholders and laydown-able back seat. You get used to the speedometer being in the middle of the dash quiet fast. The ride is smooth and the car is quiet. The power locks, windows and mirrors just adds to the experience. You are sure to love it as much as me!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CD/ radio and extra iPod hook up is awesome. You get used to the speedometer being in the middle of the dash quite fast. The middle seat belt in the back is a 3 pointer but it can be tucked away with easy access later on if you want to put it away. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There are some things I would change, such as the manual seat adjusters and manual steering wheel adjuster (I was spoiled in my last car). My boyfriend likes when we take my car out some evenings (he has a large SUV), because we can park more easily and in smaller "parking spaces". You can hear the traveling noise at higher speeds, but that doesn't matter much to myself. Knowing that I get really good gas mileage makes up for that.</TEXT>

Fun to drive, excellent wheel response, and great MPG made the Yaris a prime choice. While it doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles as other cars such as the Nissan Versa or Honda Fit, it's not a 5-door station wagon like they are either. This 3-door compact has been nothing but fun since I got it and I've already began throwing on a variety of TRD Performance goodies that will keep my warranty intact. </TEXT>

However, if you're in the wind, just BE EXTRA CAREFUL. I came from a huge suv to this little car so just be aware that you can't drive it the same. U-turns are the best now. Parking? Yeah, buddy! Racing? Not so much. Toyota, if you're reading this, change a bunch of stuff!! Then give me another one! I heart Yaris!</TEXT>

It has a lot of room inside for my senior parents to get out with ease and comfortable for them. I love this car and so does my wallet when it comes to the gas. And it has a place for my coffee to sit that does not spill.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I searched for months for the best new small car. This Yaris is even better than the professional ratings. This car is energetic, maneuverable, gutsy, cheap to run, responsive, fun, good looking, quiet. Combines economy and power. Runs forever on $10 of gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Yaris is a car that originally was introduced in Europe a few years ago, where I rented one and tried it out. I fell in LOVE with it, and wished that I could have one here in the states. Alas, the US had not approved them. (Perhaps the competition was just too much - so safe, fun, and amazing on gas.) Anyhow, when they came I had to see what they had done to them. It was utterly amazing! They are priced very reasonably. The hatchback has tons of space inside, innovative ideas & design features like three glove boxes, lots of safety, amazing handling & control, and nice interiors. I love driving it! It is really fun to drive, and very comfortable. I love the gas mileage and small size too!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the glove boxes for both driver and passenger, and the space saving ideas. I love how roomy it is, even with it being such a compact car. I love the flat folding backseat because I can put more in it than most cars can hold. It is great in lots of terrains and all weather.</FAVORITE>

I have never had so many people ask me about my Yaris. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Yaris a few weeks ago. I used to own a Hyundai Elantra and this is far better. When you are on the highway or in the city it really gets up and goes, unlike the Elantra. It gets great gas mileage and is super cute. The only thing I don't like about it are the cup holders. There are two for bottles in the doors, but the main center one is a bit too far back to be useful when you are driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Im 63 so I wanted a cheap, basic, mileage car. I guess in my generation the basics are the basics. I don't need, cruise control, auto windows and all the rest. I did get air, stereo, power steering , five speed (dont need automatic). I also got gas mileage, that will come and go, though. I have gotten as low as 30.5 and as high as 39, it seems it's always this way, but this is honest mileage. Sticker mileage, brag mileage, and honest mileage. But the car is cute, rides good, mileage O.K. but it's NOT a turnpike cruiser with the goodies. I love it, 9.5 on a scale of 10. But over 40mph keep an eye on the speedo.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has been great so far. I make many trips back and forth from Iowa to Chicago and it is much nicer not having to fill up 3 times during the trip, instead I only have to fill up once and I still have 1/2 tank left when I get back. The only complaint I have about the vehicle is that the cup holders in front are directly in front of the heating vents so the drink gets really hot even if you close the vents. The vehicle looks small on the outside, but it has a ton of room on the inside, you would never expect that my fiance, who is 6' 4", fits very comfortably in the passenger's seat! Overall, I definitely love the vehicle and I would recommend it to anyone!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love all of the compartments! One of my favorites is in the side of the door where there is a bottle holder. You can fit a bottle in the door instead of having it wobble all around in the front cupholder.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Yaris is the 2 door hatchback, red with the 1.5 liter engine. It drives nice and smooth with little road noise. It seats 5 but more like 4. Don't expect to haul a lot of baggage but this is more for the commuters than hauling anything. Fuel economy is around 39 on the road, about what Toyota shows it at. The stereo is simple but works well. The gauges are in the middle of the dash so if anyone doesn't like the instruments being to their right to look at the speedometer than this wouldn't be the car for you. This is an economy car, no bells and whistles, but it's reliable at a cheaper price. Price of the car and gas mileage. </TEXT>

Just take it out for a drive you'll love it. Only drawback is getting used to the speedometer, it's in the middle of the dash. It took me a couple of weeks to get used to it. Get the power package, it's worth the cost. Toyota has a real winner here. If you are looking for a reliable car that gets great mileage and is fun to drive don't pass this car up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a new car with great fuel economy and a 1980s-era price tag. My bright red 2-door liftback automatic is an adorable head-turner that more than doubled my previous MPG. It sits a little higher off the ground so getting in and out is easy, and the front seat area is remarkably spacious. It feels "big" on the inside. For the price I expected a "less substantial" car, but was surprised at its grippy feel of the road and responsive handling on curves. A $20 cable from Circuit City allowed me to stream my iPod through the radio. Passenger-side airbag sensor activates the airbag based on weight. Overall a thoughtful design and intelligent vehicle at a realistic price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car for price and MPG, also because I haven't seen many around. It was a must to get the S package and a must to get the manual transmission for it's performance.

<FAVORITE>The responsiveness of the manual transmission. The dash setup is a fresh look. I feel like a sit up a little higher which gives me a better view of the road.

<TEXT>I bought my Yaris about 2 months ago and so far it is meeting all my expectations. The dealer only had one lift-back and one sedan on the lot the day I was there. I chose the lift-back over the sedan because I didn't want a car that looked like every other car out there. This car is different - it draws a lot of attention. I love that this car is roomy and comfortable to drive. Compared to my last 2-dr this car is easy to get in and out of the back seat. I am getting around 35 mpg and hope for better as I continue to break her in - but even if 35 is the best I get it beats my last car by 10 mpg so I'll take it! It's a lot of car for the size and the price. Very satisfied.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I were on the market for a new vehicle for over a month. A long story short - we bought the Yaris and although my wife says she had a little buyers remorse, I had NONE. My impressions so far: it was sluggish at first but 5000 miles later it's a different car. The mpgs are between 37 and 43. It seems like the AC doesn't affect the fuel consumption at all. At first the car seems a little cheaply made but it grows on you tremendously. 1st, 3rd and 5th gear are EVIL! The only thing I would change is firm up the suspension and put slightly wider tires - the car doesn't like to take corners fast. Advice - always break in your new car (3000 rpm MAX for the first 5000 miles). Thks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a vehicle that was fuel efficient for the commute to work (75 miles rd trip). I put a deposit on my sedan around the beginning of August. Prior to that, I went to about 5 dealerships and could not find a sedan that had the power package. After narrowing my focus down to one dealership. I had them search for a sedan with the power package. They located one coming into the port of NY that had everything I was looking for in addition to side/curtain airbags and keyless entry. They informed me that it would take about 4 weeks to arrive. My Yaris was delivered to the dealership in about 3 weeks. After declining all the dealer-installed options, I happily took possession. </TEXT>

I was chosing between Chevy Aveo, Nissan Versa and Honda Fit. After long and careful research, I've decided that Toyota Yaris is the most economical and best looking option. I got my Yaris absolutely red, with power package, all weather guard package, keyless entry, ABS, automatic transmission, 60/40 split. I originally ordered blue, but aparently those are harder to get, but once I saw the red I never looked back. I am looking forward to the excelent gas mileage!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Do you want to get at fuel manufactures? Yaris is the answer. Two days ago,i traveled 525 miles with one tank. To fill up, at fuel price $2.48 at costco. Total little less than $28.00. Wow!!!... The wife and i bought last one at the dealership. Salesman, told us, that the dealership can not order them fast enough. As soon as they come in,they're gone. Highly recommend it. If your a camary owner, leave your camary at home. Use your camary for the weekends,and your yaris for commuting. Get yours right now,before they're all gone. Sell your mercedes, and buy a yaris for each member of your immediate family. Have fun enjoy the savings with your yaris,and spend the extra money wisely.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very fun to drive. No other car can match the price with as much as the Yaris offers. I disagree with the reveiws of the Yaris in respect to the reveiw says and I quote "Yaris has a slow-off-the line acceleration." For there only being 106 horses under the hood the Yaris is extremely powerful for a 4-cylinder. Anyone looking for a car that is reliable, comfortable, fuel-effiecient, and last but not least a car that will last a long long time. An interesting side note: Toyota has the highest resale value of any auto manufacturer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I write a review earlier, immediately after buying the car. Having owned it for a month, the only obvious fault I have experienced with it is the quality of the front part of the seat back on the drivers seat. The polyester cloth has worn/frayed where I enter/exit the vehicle. Apparently my belt and belt loop has worn the cloth on the lower left of the driver's seat. I tried to contact Toyota through the computer help line with no results. The seat was worn with less than 500 miles on the car. I am thin and in good shape, my weigh has nothing to do with the poor quality material being used. Dealership will try and help me, I hope. Rain always drips in the windows, rain shields a must.</TEXT>

The Yaris was just being introduced and gas prices were rising. Those were big factors for me in purchasing this vehicle. This is my first foreign car that I've ever owned. I also choose a foreign vehicle because of the reliability. I plan to drive this vehicle for many years. The ride is wonderful, I fill the tank 2 times a month. It rides smoothly for a small car and you really feel like your riding in a big car. I also like all the airbags and saftey options this car has! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ease of getting in the vehicle. The back door (3'd) is at the perfect height for ease of putting stuff in and taking stuff out. The indoor lights that come on after you shut the car off are cool. The look of the interior is sleek!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Replacement for my '88 Corolla FX HB after it blew up. This automatic 2 dr LB is a perfect commuter car for me - point A to B with no nonsense. Plenty of room-I take it to Costco. Parks almost anywhere and turning radius is awesome. Although pricy,$16K out the door, but I really wanted auto windows & doorlocks. I'm 6'4" and there are very few cars, even full size, that'll accomodate me. In this car my head, legs, knees, and elbows have room to spare. Major complaint - rated at 39MPG yeah right, at 1500 miles I'm only averaging 34 which is great but I only drive freeway with very little stop and go & follow all the recommendations to get better mileage but haven't gotten to 39MPG as others.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, love the side turning blinkers, sound system, funky little helper windshield wiper (front), Blazing Blue color, roomy, center panel is weird but who cares, I rarely look at it - too busy going 80MPH</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought this car and cannot say enough how much I enjoy this vehicle. The gas mileage is truly awesome and the handling is great. The only negative I have found so far is that the gas and brake pedal are a little to close together for a person with larger feet, but I have adjusted to it. Overall I am very impressed with the value for my money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just love this car. If you've ever driven a Camry, this is just a scaled down version of one, in my opinion. With the 15" wheels, it hugs the curves and has good acceleration. I was going 80mpg and never realized it. That's part of the Toyota experience. You can't go wrong with anything built by Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Being my first car, I first decided on buying the Yaris for its great price, cute looks and awesome mileage. I drive ~26 miles/day and have been averaging 36mpg. The acceleration is a little sluggish while raising from 0-20 but after that no complaints! It took me a day to get used to the centered dashboard, but now..I like this better that the conventional behind-the-steering placing. I feel that this way, my eyes are not completely off the road while glancing at the speedometer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just to start off with this is my fourth toyota that i have driven since 1970 [my first toyota corolla hatchback}. I kept this one 7 years and sold it to my friend for 75.00 and he kept it for two more years, the only thing in all the years that i changed was a transmission because i was a new driver in 1970 and was a little rough, i had a manual trans. I have since had a tercel, echo, and presntly driving a Yaris which i adore and the style i love especialy the interior, my car is a blue royal and inside is black which looks really sleek.My car is and untill toyota shows me that that can not continue to build reliable and fuel efficient cars i will die being a toyota consumer, </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was trying to get a car with high MPG and lowers costs with lots of fun and quality and bought the Yaris hatchback. After few weeks, I noticed that some of the interior materials are of questionable quality. Also, once I'm on a highway at more than 55 MPH, I need to grab the steering with 2 hands as it feels unsecure, even worst at crosswinds. I'm not getting the MPG advertised and I'm not a heavy footer. All In all my expectations were high and I'm ready to trade in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Yaris as an automatic only because the buyers haven't given consideration to people who want one with power package, and a manual transmission. I love control and the manual trans. rocks. There are a few annoying rattles from under the dash, and hopefully the dealer will take care of it, without having to take it apart. The sound system rocks, as they've improved the sensitivity to discriminating ears. I haven't found the magic way to get good gas mileage... maybe turning the car off, while coasting down a hill will help. All in all, I still love my Toyota Yaris!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I just bought the odd car 2 days ago so the above evaluation is probably premature but accurate for as long as I had the car! I traded my Tacoma in, and I've always had a truck, and at age 56, this is a new experience! I wanted the smallest, ugliest great gas mileage vehicle I could afford... and bingo... here's the Yaris! Roomy inside, plenty of pep, and fun, yes, fun to drive. I have the 5 speed, and it's a riot to drive! Only drove it approximately 125 miles so far, but it looks like that will cost me around 10 bucks to fill up. Whew! I was getting tired of always looking at the gas gauge. And the Tacoma was a 4 cylinder getting around 20 mpg! Don't like the daytime driving lights, though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The fit and finish on my liftback was better than expected (even for a Toyota). The doors sound firm and heavy when shut. I am a long time Honda owner (6 total). I think I just converted. The seats are quite comfortable for what is described as entry level. They have enough side stability to keep you in place around tight turns. I fit two- 220+ lb, 6 ft adults in the back seat for an hour ride with no problem. The manual transmission is very responsive and sounds like it should be driven at a higher rpm in 2nd and 3rd compared to what I expected (a tach would be nice). Freeway on ramp acceleration with the manual is quite good. You can u turn on a residential street with feet to spare.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Oil filter is in a great place. Front cupholders directly in front of the a/c vents to cool my drinks (sorry to the coffee drinkers). Stability at 65 MPH. The seats feel of good quality, unlike other entry level cars. Shoulder belt for the middle rear passenger can easily be used by smaller children.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like it. I'm 6'7" about 270 lbs, and I truly enjoy it and fit comfortably, if that says anything about the interior. It lacks power but makes up for it in gas mileage. It is also fun to drive, gets around great, and the sedan makes you wonder how there is that much space in such a small car. It is a great little commuter car and I get everything I expected to get out of it. They are hard to find. I had to get the base model and lack of keyless entry is making me nuts, but can be added. Cup holders and speedometer placement are... different and take getting used to. I'm picky so I replaced the speakers after 1 day, and it was not an easy processes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior space is great. The trunk is surprisingly roomy. For a small engine it zips around well on the highway through traffic at 80 MPH. I think it rides and handles great; add maneuverability to that and it makes it a great car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love this car, first tank from dealer, got 401 miles, wasnt sure how many gal they had put in, but with a 11.1 gal tank I knew I was close to 40 mpg. Let the last bar start flashing before I filled tank, drove 5 miles while it flashed, stuffed 10.6 gal in the tank and took off, I work a midnight shift which is an advantage with traffic, as in I rarely have to stop. 100 mile round trip, lite traffic, and this tank I did not use this A.C. keep that in mind, kept it as close to speed limit as possible, very rare to go over 70 mph, this car love to go 60 mph, anyway I made one tire pressure adjustment from 29 lbs (dealer) to 35 lbs. Drove the 10.6 gals for 449 miles for 42.3 mpg. Love it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is just another example of Toyota's great products. The Yaris has an awesome turning radius - I can turn around in a two lane street with just barely edging on a driveway. For a 4cyl it can get you to whatever speed you need just fine. I consistently get 38/44 mpg city/highway. Seats are very comfortable w/ plenty of leg room - in front and in back. The folddown seats have already come in handy for college trips. I love the mp3/cd player & AUX jack. I didn't buy the power pkg to save money & I am just fine with my decision thus far. Everyone is impressed with they way my Yaris looks inside and out. I feel like I'm driving an expensive BMW the way some people look at me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turning radius, gas mileage, new center dashboard, trunk space, fold down seats, smooth ride for an economy car, mp3 player, decent speakers, the gear shift is neat and very useful - it's easy to shift to neutral at stops, or drive in D3 around town to save on even more gas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>AMAZING car. I drive more on the gas conservative-side and I get 39 mpg in the CITY (yes, that's for the full tank of gas, not just one trip)! If I remember correctly I got about 45 mpg highway with no effort. My mom has a Corolla and there really isn't a substantial difference in interior space, nor trunk space. I like the new dashboard and how it is positioned in the middle; it's more visible and allows for more visibility out the windshield. I recommend this car to anyone who has a family of 4 or less, looking to save money on gas, like to be comfortable, and have all the reliability you could ask for from Toyota.

I do get pushed around on the interstate or with gusty winds, but laugh at the SUV drivers and their gas mileage. It is a fun car to drive and the only thing that I wished was driiferent after driving it for a month is the high beam indicator not being able to dim with the dash lights. Fun to drive and great on gas and plenty of room. I change my rating to an overall 10.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a good example of Toyota quality for a reasonable entry level price. In this day of increasing fuel prices this is an exccellent commuter car. My car has 15" tires and the ride is considerably better than one would imagine with a small car. The back seats slide fore and aft to create either more leg room, or more cargo room, a nice feature at any price point. A/C is standard and the electric power steering is the best yet. For those who care, you can connect your iPod to the center console. It takes a little getting used to to have a center gauge stack, but the resultant three gloveboxes are worth it. The EPA sticker is accurate, which is nice for a change!</TEXT>

<TEXT> I am thrilled with my Yaris!! It is stylish, comfortable, fun to drive and economical! Of course, with gas prices being what they are these days I wouldn't mind being able to claim about 10 miles per gallon more than what I am now recording. However, 38/39 m.p.g. on the freeways and 32/33 m.p.g. in-town driving isn't too shabby considering it's the summer months and I'm driving with the air-conditioner on full blast! I think I got a great deal on my 2007 Yaris. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love everything about this car except the lack of power and maneuverability on snow - it likes to slip, slide, and get stuck in a couple inches of snow pretty easily (I live in Wisconsin). In non-snow and non-icy conditions, it drives smoothly and has plenty of pep for the size. I love the way it looks inside and out. It is roomier than it would appear from the outside. The cupholders are extremely handy - better placed than any other car I have owned. Best of all, I get excellent gas mileage - overall I get around 34-35 mpg, but on a long all-highway trip I am able to get 38. That's hard to beat with a non-hybrid - and this car is comfortable! I would highly recommend this vehicle overall!</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I bought my Yaris in 2006, I posted a quick review. I wanted to follow after 2.25 years and 40k miles. I commute 36 miles one way to work in often heavy traffic. The Yaris is great for this. It stops quickly, and starts quickly. For maintenance, so far I have changed the oil and air filters and replaced the front tires. If I keep my speed around 60 (the speed limit, btw), I get over 40 mpg; real nice when gas was $4 per gallon. When we go to lunch, my colleagues like to pile in just to ride in it. I still love the car and highly recommend it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>iPod jack, 5 speed, handling on the highway, fold down rear seat. Not sure if its a feature really, but the small size makes parking and maneuvering in the city a pleasure.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Yaris for a little over a year and a half. Amazing gas mileage one of the things I love, it's got quite a lot of oomph when you want it. I think it's probably best as a tuner car. I don't recommend it as a family sedan though, unless you have snow tires on it, it slides everywhere in the winter, the car's too light for decent winter driving. Also I'm expecting and am very afraid to put my child in the car, I've seen them get totaled at 15 mph. As much as I do love this little car, I hate it at the same time, wish it was safer. As it stands with a little one on the way I'm searching for something else. It'll make me sad to see it go, but I gotta do what's best for my family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car new, our first car, when we just got married. The car has served us well. We have not had one single issue with the car in 42,000 miles. Have not even had to replace the brakes. This car returns mpg numbers up to 39 on the highway, 36 in mixed driving, 34 city in warm weather. In the winter, we avg 33 mixed. The interior design and quality are good, but the seating position front and rear are very upright, which on trips an hour or more becomes quite apparent. It is also very narrow inside. Automatic transmission has been flawless. This car basically needs no major maintenance til 100,000 miles, not even spark plugs or tranny fluid change. A great first car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Yaris a year before it became the model year, it had 19 miles on it. The car is reliable, I've never had a problem with it running. It is unbelievably peppy for such a small engine, the car climbs to speed easily on the road. Gas mileage is fantastic. It's all the hybrid mpg without the hybrid price. The only cons against it is that there is no rpm or battery gauge, and it does not handle well on turns at high speeds. The dashboard is all plastic, and while it has tons of storage room up front, my two glove compartment doors do not line up properly with the dash for whatever reason. I would recommend this car to absolutely anyone in the market for a small, hybrid-ish car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always had larger cars with all the bells & whistles (i.e. Pontiac Bonneville SSEI, Lincoln Town Car Signature Series). Due to my long commute to work and the cost of gas, I checked out the Yaris after seeing it on the government's fuel economy website. I bought the manual transmission Yaris S Sedan the same day. My last tank of gas averaged 42.3 mpg compared to my previous vehicles 18 mpg. No bell or whistle can outweigh those numbers! I love driving it and everyone is amazed at the room inside.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my quirky black Yaris liftback for about three months now, and I couldn't be happier. The first couple tanks of gas worried me, because I wasn't getting the mileage I expected, but since then it's been great, between 32 and 40 mpg depending on the mix of driving I'm doing at any given time. I love the styling inside and especially out. Even for an hour-long commute, which I sometimes have to do, the ride is quite comfortable for such a small car. The seats are perfectly comfortable for me. The steering and acceleration are very responsive, which make it fun to drive, not what I expected for such an economical price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive about 120 miles a day and I am getting 44 mpg on the highway. Blended city/hway I'm getting 38... If you drive hard you will get a bit less but doing 70 and hold back on the jack rabbit starts and you should get the same. I have the automatic and the performance is fine. It's not the fastest car, but there is plenty of power to hang out and pass on the highway. Overall the car is great, it runs great, rides great, just a great price performers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a terrific small car that is fuel efficient and easy to handle... great for parking in snug spots. Has lots of hidden storage and is very roomy for its size. This car turns heads and is fun to drive. The negative to this car is the engine runs loud, especially at about 45-60 mph ~ but then at higher or lower speeds it has a nice comfortably low engine sound... it just takes getting used to. The seats are very comfortable and made to be supportive. I love the instrument panel being in the center and often wonder why it being behind the steering wheel never bothered me all those years ~ it is actually very user friendly. This is a great affordable car IF you can find one on a lot!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hidden dash storage and lots of cup holders. The instrument panel in the center is a big plus. The fold down seats are perfect for traveling. It even provides a comfortable room for our big dogs to stretch out for the trip and still have a bit of room on the floor & back of the car for luggage!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It does not have the handling and performance of the 2003 Dodge Neon that I traded in but the fuel savings are about 40 dollars a week so far. I have put about 300 miles on it this week and should average about 400 or so a week. It is a lighter car than I am used to and the only plus so far in this car is the economics. I have yet to take it on any long trips but would rather have this Yaris than the Neon when it come to gas prices. I am saving about 5 or so miles a gallon so far in the city and should save 10 on the highway. I would say that this is an average car and does what it was built to do. Save on fuel, not on style or personality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I fell in love with the Liftback when I test-drove it in May 2006. I ordered the 2007 Yaris Liftback automatic transmission in Blazing Blue with the All Weather and Convenience Packages. It ended up coming with an armrest and rear bumper protector too. I took almost 2 months to get here but was well worth the wait. With my first tank of gas I averaged 42 mpg (about 75% highway/25% local driving.) I find that it is zippy to drive,accelerates well to get onto highways with ease. The controls are easy to operate.The center instrument panel is no trouble.The seating is very comfortable. You sit uphigh and feel like you are in an SUV. I love my Yaris!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great fuel economy. smooth ride, comfortable seating. Center instrument panel is cool and not distracting. Love the CD player/ sound system. Great tight turning. Solid suspension.

<TEXT>I have had this car for 2 days and love it. I am 6?2? tall, and I fit in the back seat fine, I own the car of course so drive in it. The car is zippy. I call it my little Buzz Buzz. No problem in corners, acceleration is nice (I have the 5 speed manual) and I do not think the price can be beat. It is everything the Echo should have been (and could have been since it shares the platform with the Echo and the Scion xA). For weighing less than 2300 lbs, it does not feel terribly light, but I have not driven it in a wind storm yet. I commute about 30 miles a day and no problems. The interior build quality is fantastic! Not to mention I get 3 glove boxes, a little waste bin, and 5 cup holders.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My old car died, suddenly, so I had to buy a car quickly. I did not think I could afford a new one, but saw the Toyota Yaris. Wow, this car is HOT! I called many dealerships to find one, as soon as these cars arrive on the lot they are sold and I can see why. This car gets unbelievable gas mileage. The first tank full I got 40.2mpg the second tank full 41mpg and I don't live anywhere near a highway. It is a fun car to drive, quite zippy, but obviously lacks power on the big hills. It is comfortable to drive and has nice seats. I am delighted with it. I can't believe the price of it, rich or poor, this is a great car to buy and drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas mileage per gallon of course! I do like the position of the odometer and speedometer. Gives the driver a feeling of having more room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Small on the outside, roomy on the inside. Material quality and fit are very good. Performance is surprising for a 108 HP engine. Brakes and handling are excellent. Fuel mileage in heavy rush hour traffic and steep hills is averaging 37 MPG. Fits four full-sized adults with comfort. Easy to get in and out of. Seating position is elevated with unobstructed view. Toyota has done their homework well and has produced a solid economy car with a styling edge. Add 17" sport wheels,a spoiler and some sport trim pieces and the car will definitely turn heads.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Yaris has far exceeded my expectations after reading lackluster reviews. It is as quiet as my wife's Mercedes on the highway, with far better gas mileage. It doesn't feel cramped at all. The stereo is decent, not great, but it's all in the speakers which are easily changed. I have the pwr pkg, which has upgraded trim, well worth it. Auto has very smooth operation, and the electric steering is buttery. Very solid on hwy, no small car feel. When I walk to the garage and have the option of the Mercedes E320 or the Yaris - it's always the Yaris for me. FYI - the dash lightup at night is very, very nice. The center gauges mean no reflection on the windshield in front of you at night.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first saw this car, I figured there was no way my 6'2" son was gonna fit in it. Not only does he fit comfortably, but he has more room in the Yaris than in my Prius. This is a great car for a college kid: inexpensive, fuel efficient, and not big enough to haul his buddies everywhere. I was very impressed with the quality of this car. Unlike most compacts, it has doors with the depth of most full- size cars. When I was in college I owned a 1982 Toyota Tercel. This car reminds me a lot of that vehicle. With gas prices only going up, this car made too much sense for me to pass up when choosing a car for my son.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove the Yaris out of pure curiosity, and ended up buying one an hour later. The smooth, quiet ride and zippy acceleration are unlike any other compact car I've ever driven. I was worried about handling with it's rear torsion bar suspension, but it handles like a sports car - I've already had a fun day in the mountains with it. I drive 100 miles a day, and the fuel economy (38mpg so far) is saving me $80-100 a week on gas versus my old truck. I recommend this car to anyone - it surpasses any and all expectations - even for a Toyota!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love my new Yaris. It has given me great mileage, actually going more than the promised 39mpg, closer to 41 or 42. I have had it about a month to the day, and have only had to fill it up twice, have put more than 400 miles on it. I would like to know however if the safety tests have been done yet on it. I bought it because I had such good success with my first car, a Toyota Celica, and so I trust Toyota, and so far, have found nothing to complain about. I especially like that the "hump" in the dashboard is in the middle, rather than on the drivers side, obstructing my view. Would still like to know safety rating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At first, I was taken back by how small this car is. But, when I climbed inside I was amazed at how much interior room there is. The center console is different, but once you get used to it, it's actually more convenient than peering through the steering wheel like most cars. The car corners very well and is surprisingly resistant to being blown around on the highway (for a subcompact anyway). Toyota managed to get the price down by making features optional that come standard on other cars, so expect to pay more than the base MSRP (but it's worth it). Availability is limited in 2006, so you may have to be patient if you're picky about options. Great car; would buy again! </TEXT>

<TEXT>So my last car was a Honda Accord. I know its not fair to judge this car based on my past vehicle but Im pretty sure that is why I'm not wholly astounded. I find this car to be quite bumpy on the road (as expected from such a small lightweight car), & I truly hate the brakes. I feel like the car is almost out of control when braking. When driving on a bumpy road I feel like I'm riding a bike on a cobblestone road. Maybe I'm not used to it but I've been driving it for 2 weeks already. Car sounds like a tank when accelerating, and really can't keep up with other cars. Overall, I expected better but its still not a bad car. And for the price & toyota name I really can't complain.</TEXT>

I have a 30+ mile commute each way, and should save 15 MPG compared to my Rav4... which alone should save me almost my car payment. Surprisingly roomy, feels much bigger than the Corolla. We have 2 small kids in car seats and this car will allow us to take the Yaris instead of the 4Runner around town. I haven't found a complaint yet with it... The Corolla in its current form is in trouble. This car is $3000 cheaper than a Corolla, feels bigger and is a heck of a lot better to look at.</TEXT>

There are a few things that take some getting used to, including the center-mounted display, but after about 2 days I began to wonder why all cars don't have it. For a pretty small car, the Yaris sure does have plenty of leg room. It will whip in and out of traffic in the city, and when you take it out on the interstate, it will absolutely fly down the road with suprising comfort. Overall very fun to drive, good looking, and a smart move considering the price of gas these days.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall I really like my new purchase of the Toyota Yaris. The interior could have a few more features, like a temperature gauge and other normal stats. Its small compared to the average American vehicle, which makes it extremely easy to parallel park in smaller spots and to maneuver around things. It'd be nice to have some faster acceleration, but I guess thats just a trade-off for a car with good gas mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car replaces the Echo, which was a good car, just ugly. Now since the ugly is gone it's perfect. My new Yaris is beautiful. The short shifter lets me sap up as much as the little 1.5 engine can be expected to provide. I get over 10 miles more than the Kia Rio per gallon out of the Yaris I feel good about saying that this is probably the best little car ever made. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Center console (seems weird, but great for view and night vision. I like it), Nice factory radio with 6x9's in the back. Short shifter. Fold down rear seats. Perfectly placed cupholders. Can't help but smile when you see it. Oh, and the gas mileage is something to smile about</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far this car is adding up to the reason why I bought it - great gas mileage. I am constantly told how classy this car is. It is pretty roomy inside and the dash is great. So far I am averaging between 30-34 mpg. The only criticism I have is the compartments or lack of near the driver side. They are hard and even impossible to reach when standing still let alone driving. Overall so far a great car that drives nice on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We now have 600+ miles on our loaded liftback. Both wife and I are impressed with it's comfort, handling and design. We have mostly stick-shift cars over last 35 yrs, including 3 ALFAS & a Ford Fiesta. This car is similar to the Fiesta, and gets thru the turns as good as the Alfas, maybe better. Have not pushed the engine or brakes yet, but appears they will do quite well. Only 1/2 way thru 2nd tank of gas; got 35.5 MPG on first tank. It gets lots of looks on the road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the exterior and interior style. Can't miss this car on the road. All the interior storage is great. I am 6'3", 200 lbs and can sit "behind myself" in the backseat. We also easily transported both of our folding bikes with the rear seat down. A/C works great, and wife loves the upholstery.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is a great little car! We sold her 2004 Prius to get this one. She was not getting to take advantage of the gas mileage on the Prius for the payment we were paying. So I sold it on ebay for $3000 more than we owed and bought the Yaris. What a deal. The payment was half and the mileage is about the same as she was getting. And the insurance is less. Plus, in 48 months the car will be paid for, just in time for our youngest to take it to college! The oldest get my Prius. lol The Yaris is very fun to drive I like to drive it when I get the chance. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have several cars, a newer Corvette & a 05 Jeep. With the gas prices & my husbands long comute we went looking for a more economical car. This is the perfect car. At 6'2" and 215 my husband is not a small guy, he loves this car! At first everyone teased him at work, now everyone one wants one. He loves the power, the solidness & everyone knocks on our door at home & wants to know what it is! My husband wears a suit to work. The other day, 5 large guys in suits paged him to the parking lot & were sitting in the car just to prove you could fit car! He loves open window air & this is the first car he has owned that he can open the window and there is no noise or wind. Toyota has a winner. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife just sold her standard cab Tacoma and after a couple weeks of searching for a Scion tC, we decided to look at the Yaris. I WAS a little hesitant as it was fairly small looking. When we got there to see it and test drove it, we knew we wanted it. It's a great car that gets GREAT gas mileage, is fun to drive, and feels really solid. I could only go up to 10 on the rating, but if I could, I'd go well above that. Great car, great price, great mileage!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>A very good car. I'm 6'3'' and fit comfortably but snugly into the car. The principle options I wanted were the convenience package, antilock brakes, and side impact airbags.

<TEXT>First, I'm not a fan of the sedan, it is rather ordinary while the 3 door liftback is anything but. This is a great car! It's built beautifully. I'm 6 foot 4 and have plenty of room, as much or more than most larger cars. It is an optical illusion, small on the outside, big on the inside. The center gauges make me wonder why they haven't been there standard for years, now the speed easily comes into my line of view as I am scanning for traffic, rather than having to avert my eyes and see through the steering wheel. The car stops, steers and just in general, feels very good. I have a hard time referring to it as an economy car, it is cheap to run but there is nothing "cheap" about it.</TEXT>

Acceleration is a tad slow in the first three gears, but not enough to be noticable. This car goes 85-95 mph daily on a 180 mile a day commute.

<TEXT>I bought the Yaris because since I wanted Toyota quality and fuel efficiency. It seems to work well and has good performance. I drove the 07 Camry CE manual and did not notice a significant difference from the Yaris manual sedan. I believe it's the power/weight ratio... which is approximately the same. A little pricy compared to Korean competitors... I would have paid extra for the side impact airbags and antilock brakes but was told they may never ship the side impact airbags... if so for at least 5 months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Echo for a Yaris and I am blown away by how luxurious this entry level car feels. Even with 2 hp less than the Echo, the Yaris feels like a Corolla and has no problem accelerating and keeping up with traffic. The new suspension and electric steering makes handling feel more like a European car than Japanese. It also has a very quiet ride on the highway and is comfortable for long trips. And for those weary about the cupholders being up near the vents, don't worry, it holds drinks very tightly. They also make a good spot for your cellphone. I hope to have this car until the day it dies, which will be a long, long time.</TEXT>

There is sufficient room for passengers and the seats are plain but supportive. There are enough bells and whistles to make it feel like a more expensive vehicle. It is stable and nimble to drive, even at highway speeds. Fuel efficiency has been absolutely fantastic.</TEXT>

There is so much storage I don't know what to put in it. From what I can tell the back seat is pretty roomy too. (I think the doors have shrink-rays in them). The outside looks so small, but the interior is extremely spacious. Each day I am discovering more things - like the sun visor extenstions!

<TEXT>Bought this one because of absurd oil prices. Wanted a reliable smaller car that was good on gas but still had some interior room. The economy is good and I'm averaging around 30 so far. Headroom is fine. Road noise is still too intrusive. The doors need protective moldings. The dash is terrible and too far away to read properly. Why can't Toyota put the dash where it belongs? The old style 4 speed automatic sometimes is jerky and I would wish for a newer 5 speed automatic like some competitors use. Also more power would be appreciated.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased this vehicle on the 23rd of March, so my review is based on only 500 miles of usage. This vehicle is an excellent price, it handles corners very well, it has enough get-up-and-go on the highways that I have to be careful, it is extremely well-designed. I'm a large person (6'3'', 260 lbs.) and I have no shortage of space. I took my parents and wife for a drive and no one was cramped. The back seat has an unusual amount of room. I have plenty of head and leg room, and if you need to, the back seat folds flat for a good amount of cargo space. And at 40 mpg, who can complain. I'm saving enough to cover my car payment!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle new in May, 2006. I have received mixed reviews from friends and family regarding the looks and size of the car, but my intention was to purchase a car that was good on gas with the reliability of a Toyota. I average approximately 36 miles per gallon, mostly freeway with some in town. I am 6 feet tall and have plenty of leg and head room. Anyone sitting behind me is cramped. My complaint, is the positioning of the steering wheel. Because I have to have the seat all the way back, the steering wheel is too far away and I find myself constantly shifting steering hands because of the discomfort. Would be nice if the wheel telescoped. Truly annoying!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I originally owned the Toyota Echo, which was truly the best car I ever owned. But I was hit by a red light runner and the car was totaled, I as well as the police and wrecker driver were amazed at the interior compartment, it had no damage at all but the front of the car was completely destroyed. So after that experience with the Echo , I went out and bought the new replacement for the Echo , which was a 2007 Yaris Sedan. The car is basic , because it was bought for my long 94 mile commute to work, but the car has quickly become my wifes favorite car, she always leaves behind her 7 passenger fully loaded SUV to drive my basic 5-speed Yaris, which she absolutely love. We love this car !</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We have 3 kids which means 2 boosters and a large car seat, and we all 5 fit in the car, it also has a very large trunk. The car gets consistent 40 mpg , which is not nearly as good as the Echo but is still excellent. Dependability .</FAVORITE>

I will soon be driving 90 miles a day round trip and look forward to the gas mileage and savings. I have actually gotten 42 MPG on road trips. I bought this vehicle after my stepson purchased his Yaris. I was told it would take 4 weeks to get the vehicle, but the dealer had one in 3 days.

<TEXT>I purchased my Yaris liftback about 2 years ago, and it's the first car that never gave me buyer's remorse. I've owned luxury cars, 4x4s, station wagons, sedans, and sports cars. Every one of them forced me to compromise. I'm in a band, and I can fit a Marshall half-stack, 2 JBL monitor cabs, 4 guitars, a bag of cords, a change of clothes, and my girlfriend in my Yaris. Usually, five can ride comfortably. It's so good on gas, I sometimes forget which side the gas cap's on. This car is the perfect blend of economy, utility, and style. Complete strangers are so fascinated by it, they strike up conversations with me in parking lots. With rising fuel costs, this car is the way to go. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy, go-kart handling, incredible cargo/passenger capacity for its size. It has 3 glove boxes, iPod jack, and more cubbies and cupholders than I know what to do with.

<TEXT>I've had my 2007 Yaris for a year, and I love it. My drive to work is 65 miles round trip per day, so I really needed a fuel efficient car, and this is the perfect fit! Initially I was drawn to the car because it was cute and small and reminded me of the SmartCar, however I was pleasantly surprised by all of the perks! I've been stopped on multiple occasions by strangers intrigued by the car & can do nothing but brag about it. The backseat leg room is unbelievable, the amount of storage (including all 3 glove boxes) is amazing, & the gas mileage is wonderful. My only complaint is how sensitive the car is to wind on the highway. I love the car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Yaris, I'm hoping a 2009 or 2010 is coming out, because I would like to get another one.The front seats needs more padding, because on long drives it gets uncomfortable. I love the power it has to get out in traffic, and the gas mileage. It is sporty and peppy i have had people to stop and ask me about my Yaris. I also like that it holds its value very well. I traded my Echo to this Yaris. I liked the Echo's placement of the speedometer better where it was turn towards the driver, but I do love it in the center of the dash instead over the steering column. I'm short, so I've always had trouble trying to see the road because of speedometer being over the steering column. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Toyota Yaris had turned out to be the best car that I have ever purchased. My wife was hesitant at first however she now thinks it is a great car. The mileage is hard to beat. It now has over 30k miles and if it is driven right, I can reach 44 mpg on 1 tank of gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my car last may in 2007. I saw it on line and just new I had to have it, its a fun car to drive and very reliable. The gas is great! The only bad thing I would have to say about the car is that it doesn't have great pick up, but you have to expect that because it a four cylinder. Over all excellent car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got mine two years ago and I am proud of having driven it around, particularly nowadays when gas price is above $4 per gallon. It always gives me more than 38 mpg even when I drive it in town. I can say that of many cars I have driven in the past including Honda Accord and Civic, the Yaris is the only car I have been totally satisfied with in every aspect. Since it is so cute, my wife who drives a Honda Accord begs me to drive hers and her to drive mine. Last year I purchase another Yaris for my son.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pros: mileage still great at 37mph highway though I lost 2-3 mph when ethanol is added. Easy to park, and get in/out of. Adequate storage. A/C excellent. Dash layout excellent. Cons: seats are uncomfortable for long haul. Door arm rests are VERY hard! Also no standard middle console arm rest. Repairs: Rear view mirror disengaged from window. Cruise control disengaged two times for unknown reasons. Overall: We both still love the car and would buy again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car new in Sept of 07 and it was the best decision I could have made. Not only is it very reasonably priced, but you can't beat the gas mileage. I average 38-city and 43-hwy. It rides very smooth, easily gets up to highway speeds, there is a ton of room on the inside, big trunk and good sound system. Not to mention, you get Toyota excellent reliability. I'm pretty sure the body will fall off before the engine dies!! I'd say this is one of the best car you can buy right now!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car to get me from school and work to home. I've been driving a lot and my new Durango was killing me. This is a 3rd car for my family and I wasn't sure I'd like driving a car again, but I love it. I haven't driven the truck since I got it! I bought this car used, but it only had 17,000 miles and was clean. It is so fun and comfortable to drive. Peppy, handles well, rides pretty good on the freeway doing 80mph. My husband is 6'3" and fits well and my daughter sits behind him with plenty of room. I consistently get 39 mpg even going 80! Can't beat that!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Peppy and fun to drive. Comfortable, roomy, and what great mileage for the money. The trunk is huge and I don't feel like I'm driving a small car, especially when I'm used to big SUVs. I really love my car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We had a bad accident in this car. It was hit from behind while sitting still in traffic. It was estimated the other vehicle was traveling at between 40 and 50 miles an hour. While there was extensive rear end damage the cabin was not breached. My wife was injured but did walk away from the scene. If someone had been in the back seat they would have been injured but I do believe they would have walked away as well. It seems the car held up when you take into account the speed of the other car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This has to be the best car I have even owned, from point of comfort, reliability, maneuverability, gas mileage - I got 46 mpg on a 1700 mile trip from FL through the Blue Ridge mountains and up through S. and N. Carolina, VA, MD, Penna and NY! Absolutely fun to drive. Should have ordered the power windows and cruise control. Big ticket for going too fast. Wanted to stay "green" as possible. I now get 37 - 38 mpg in town, love to drive this car, and having had two hip replacements, find it much more comfortable than my former Subaru LL Bean station wagon and my Volvo 770 wagon!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seating comfort is marvelous! The driving control is sensitive and instantaneous, the gas mileage is a joy! joy! joy! The trunk on the sedan holds far more than one can imagine! The heating cooling systems, and radio are terrific! I love this car! Thank you Toyota.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always owned a Toyota Corolla. I found that the 2007 Yaris offered more interior room, trunk space and style then the Corolla and less exterior body. The price was also about 5 to 6 thousand dollars difference. Better gas mileage by far. I average 38 to 40 mpg in town and 40 to 45 mpg highway. The savings and efficiency is by far the best all around. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After putting 300k on my 2004 Matrix with only having to replace the catalitic converter I bought the Yaris as a gas saver. I had the car for 16 months, drove to from San Francisco Bay to Oregon and back, and Arizona and back with no problems. The car is more fun to drive than my Matrix and doesn't drive like an econo box. For MPG, I always averaged in the mid 30s and better when I drove like most people do. After more than 96,000 on the car in only 16 month I had no problems, but then decided to drive under a Dodge Durango. Car was totaled but I walked away without a scratch. As soon as I gey my insurance check I will be back for my third Toyota! Probably another Yaris!</TEXT>

The 4-door sedan I chose can seat 4 adults more comfortably than some larger cars I've had, and I'm averaging 44-45 mpg highway. It's a great little car for the money. I looked at several other cars of other makes, but the Yaris had everything I wanted. With my commute being mostly highway, a hybrid wasn't necessarily the best answer for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2 door hatchback for almost 2 years. First off, I describe it as driving a Pepsi can on wheels. I got so many dents from the littlest of things with this car. I had an accident from sliding down a hill of ice and hit someone from behind. The car handled well in the accident, but was expensive to fix. The worst part of having this car, was when it was windy. I had an issue where the wind hyper-extended the driver side door and it wouldn't close afterwards. It was raining at the time, ergo, the interior got soaked, which led to an interior odor, and even after the door was "fixed" by the body shop it still never worked properly. Very noisy interior.</TEXT>

I have had no reliability issues, all components work as advertised.

As long as you take care of the maintenance with dlr, drive easy you'll love the Yaris. It's easy to park, easy to maintain, maintenance is minimal (if you take care of it) and with rising gas prices how can you not want a great economical car. I love everything about it, I'm sure as newer models come out the Yaris will only improve and become a strong Toyota car. I love the options and yes, there are somethings that need to change or ad (cup holds not in good locations and would like keyless entry) other than that it's a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Toyota, but not my first micro vehicle. I've owned an 850 Fiat coupe, as well as a Renault 4CV. They were a blast to drive, and probably the reason that I was not intimidated by light-weight small cars. Those cars were much lighter than this one. Oh sure, it can be a little twitchy in the corners and on the hi-way when there's a big cross wind. And the engine, though very competent, is no Z-28 302. But for "Fun to Drive", this one is right up there. The electric power steering just feels right. It has the optional 15" tires, just to let you know. It has a secure feeling, probably due to the long wheelbase for its size. People sit up high -- nothing claustrophobic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very ergonomic, that is, easy to get in and out of, see out of, use of controls; unique -- not too many hatchbacks yet, or Yarises in general; Toyota quality (I hope); gas mileage (35 overall); did I mention handling?

<TEXT>I have a very long commute to work, and my truck's gas mileage was killing my wallet. I purchased the Yaris for Toyota reliability and the advertised fuel mileage. I got both - what I also got was an extremely uncomfortable, unsafe car. The ten minute test drive will not show just how uncomfortable the vehicle is, especially for taller individuals. Rent one first for an extended drive to make sure you "fit." Also, look at independent safety tests - the tests for the Yaris without side airbags are scary. The ride at highway speeds is extremely unstable and the vehicle is very quick to skid when braking in the rain. If safety is a concern, DO NOT BUY THE YARIS.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I mainly chose the Toyota Yaris for the fuel economy. I have averaged almost 60mpg on highway runs, and about 40mpg around town (much better than my other car)! The seating is comfortable and the interior is easy to keep clean (charcoal gray). It handles beautifully at higher speeds, even around corners! The newly redesigned headlight assembly allow great light dispersion, for improved visibility, especially if you add the Sylvania Ulta Star headlamps! Most oncoming traffic think I am running my high beams, yet I am not! The fuel tank capacity is 11.1 gallons, and I can squeeze 600 miles out of it! If you try it, you will buy it! Really deserves a second look!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Yaris. It has all the equipment I wanted in a new car, gets great gas mileage, it's a blast to drive and it's a freakin Toyota so I can rely on it for years and years to come. At first I was skeptical of the Yaris and never thought that I would own one. I kept thinking that I could never go back to a little car, especially coming out of a '95 Olds. sedan. But the more I complained about the gas mileage my tank of a car was getting, the more appealing the Yaris became. Not to mention the price point is just as attractive as the styling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car! I am a very frugal (okay, cheap) shopper who goes over everything with a fine tooth comb. This car is great. I owned a Geo Metro for 5 years and considered an Aveo. The Yaris is the best of the three with the most power performance, the most room, and the best at making me smile when I drive. IF I get rid of it before I retire, I'll looking to get another!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love all the pockets, the adjustable back seats, the cargo space, and the FUN to drive it !</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was asked to look for a reliable car for my wife and found the much loved Yaris. We have the four-door hatch here in Sydney, Australia and it's heaps user friendly. It's modded with Toyota's bigger wheels and low profile tires which help the handling.The gas mileage is exceptional especially in Sydney traffic. It has all the pep you need for an engine of that size. Off in the bush however, it needs more torque. Trunk space is good and the back seat is roomy enough for two taller set people due to the lack of the drive shaft hump on the back floor. The experience has been enjoyable and we've had no dramas in Toyota country.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The trunk compartments located under the boot(trunk)panel are convenient for storing heaps of stuff. The look of the car beats out its competitors. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have not owned it for long but being 6'3" and 255 lbs I am having a blast with this car. Everyone I know is used to me being in an F-250 or larger vehicle so I am getting used to being laughed at. With the mileage I am getting, which is on average 45 mpg, I use 1 gal per day round trip to work and home . Several co-workers have purchased one of their own. Now who is laughing? That's all I'm going to say about that! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All of them.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is just amazing. That's all there is too it. It has the pep that I wanted along with the style. Rush hour? No problem! This car can squeeze into little spaces. It also handles well on winding roads. I also have take this car off road on a 4-wheel trail in the woods somewhere in Illinois, it got muddied up and performed well. The engine has a lot of kick to it! If you want a cheap new car that is reliable, this is it! Plus the gas mileage! I get around 36 city and 42 highway. I just love the look on people's faces when a little 4-cyl zips by them. You would never expect so much spirit from such a little car. It is really worth the price!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Small, zippy, Toyota, price, quality and the ablility to handle me as a driver.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went for the 2 door hatchback, manual, convenience package only. I was looking for a cheap, brand new car, and I got more than I ever thought I would. Being the most basic package, there's not a whole lot of extra safety features, but I almost feel like I don't need them. Handling is excellent; it is as responsive as I figured for a 106 hp engine. The interior doesn't feel cheap and I enjoy all of the extra compartments. Everyone who has gotten in it for the first time is amazed at how much room there really is. Everything I brought down with me for school fit in the Yaris (bed, desks, a bike, shelves, etc). Highly recommended for someone looking for a new, cheap car that's great to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy: though I've only gotten above the rated fuel economy once (40.06 mpg), my average so far is right around 37 mpg. I love the feeling of buying 6 gallons of gas and knowing I'm set for a couple of weeks. Surprising amount of space, especially with the seats folded down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent vehicle for the price! Great commuter car! MPG is in the mid 30s in Dallas traffic. The center instrument cluster is easy to get used to, and easy to read. The steering handles very well, and the car reacts quickly when needed, but initially takes getting used to. Braking is good, but clutch can be a little stiff in stop-go traffic. It rides very well, if somewhat noisy. Lots of room for such a small car, including great head clearance both front and back, and good trunk space. Sits high, which makes entry and exit easy, and gives the feel of a larger car. This car was an excellent buy; thank you Toyota!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Responsive manual transmission, roomy, smooth ride, great fuel mileage for a non-hybrid.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Yaris is exactly what you see is what you get. The power is impressive for a 1.5L 4 cyl and trans is smooth shifting. I average 33.7 mpg; coming from a Tundra V8, I can't complain. Seats are a little tight for my middle aged expanding backside, but this car is aimed at the skinny youthful set. Center mounted instrument pod stinks!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, ease of handling in parking lots, performance for an econobox.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased 2 Yarises. I knew better from previously owning Toyotas that the Yaris would at least be reliable and fuel efficient, and to my surprise, refined (for a $15k car!) I've owned them for 6 months and so far no problems. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with my purchases.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turning radius, 35ft. best ever recorded. Center dash. Looks (best in class). MPG (best in class).Toyota refinement and reliability. Trunk space.</FAVORITE>
