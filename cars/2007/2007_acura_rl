<TEXT>Had for 1 year, 14,000 miles. Excellent fuel economy 27-30 on all highway. No mechanical problems. My wife would like an adjustable passenger seat, seating position too low. Fit and finish second to none. RL has plenty of power I use it often on steep hills. I like the styling much more than the 09 grille has a richer more elegant look than the 09. Handling is great in high speed situations, far superior to the TL. I like the exterior design, quite understated, however I do see the point of someone saying it looks too much like a Honda. I understand the 2011 will be a totally new car. Acura/Honda really does want to compete with the best from Lexus. After all is said and done would I buy it again... for sure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been an excellent purchase and both my wife and I are very pleased with the car. My only comment is that I feel the passenger seat should have the same power features as the drivers side - i.e., the seat is too low for my wife.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful paint. Ours is white pearl.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far I have owned the car for a couple of months and do not regret the purchase at all. I bought it for safety primarily but realized that it also has the legendary Honda quality. The details of this car are incredible, better than the German cars and value wise by 15 K at least also. The car feels like a tank but has the power to go when needed,. This car has near 300hp and you feel every horse! The AWD is incredible, it would take a bulldozer to take it off course. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, adaptive lights, navi, electronics are incredible, styling is sleek and practical, tire size provides stability, safety features are plentiful and seldom found in other cars as a complete package, parts are very reasonable, LED and other cabin lighting is great, drive is solid, fun to drive!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Like most readers I've driven them all, but this one delivers a lot of bang for the buck. Does not handle like a 5 series, will not out accelerate a 550i, but it handles beautifully, is great on the road, and has an interior and audio system that puts the 5 series and E-Class to shame. Put that together with Acura's reputation for reliability and we have a BIG winner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car looked like a terrific value, but it has not turned out that way. I was looking forward to "Honda Reliability" but too many things just don't work well or are gimmicky. Fuel economy is atrocious (14-15), electronics don't work that well, run-flat tires are super loud, there is some wind noise, key fob/keyless entry never works the same twice in a row. Car is pretty slow off the line, but decent on the highway. Ride is too much of a compromise. Handling is good, but the Michelin run-flats are lousy performance tires in all but the correct temperature range. I came out of an Audi A8, and would NOT buy this car again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Decent seats, amazing navigation system, bluetooth phone support works most days, climate control is basically nice, motor runs nice on the highway (not around town), interior is reasonably well done.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We wanted an AWD sedan after a string of average SUVs. This vehicle is a beauty. Excellent build quality and finish. It would be difficult to beat the value for money. It rides smoothly and is very comfortable. We are delighted with our purchase so far. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The reverse camera and interior finish. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased my RL. Build quality equal to or better than Lexus. A great value with current market support. SH-AWD useful in all weather, not just snow. A smart looking car, however not screaming 'I am here'. Had a 2004 TL and liked it, this is much more car. I hope resale is as good on this as it was on my TL. Also owned a 2001 BMW 525, no comparison. The BMW was more like my TL. RL does seem overpriced until you drive it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are very comfortable. Technology only seems confusing, takes about a week to learn. Ride and handling exceptional.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Number one attribute isno wind noise. The only reason you can hear the quiet tire noise is because there is no wind noise. Very comfy seats.Great tech features. Not enough power especially low end torque. Phenomenal handling characteristics. This car will turn on a dime with good manners. Fuel ecomony is poor, but I don't put on so many miles that it's a factor.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best stereo system ever. No wind noise. Great super handling. Best seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the car. It handles very well, a little sluggish compared to other car, MB CLK 430A, but is sufficient. I had a little bit of an initial quality problem, HID headlight on right side burned out first day or so. Car was due to go back for dealer add-ons, so no biggy. Was kinda shocked though. Key fob was nightmare for first two weeks. I made the mistake of initializing the car with driver 2's key rather than the #1 key, the car hated that. It would madly and incessantly lock/unlock and beep when I stood next to the car. Reinitialized the car to the driver 1 fob, and it hasn't happened since!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove a BMW prior to this, and loved it, but I am thrilled with my Acura RL. It is so smooth, very responsive, comfortable as it could possibly be, and has every possible bell and whistle for thousands less than its Teutonic competition. I chose it over Infiniti M35 because, in my test, it handled better, and I much prefer the looks. GREAT car so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If not the best vehicle for under $40K it has to be in the top five. Exceptional build quality, great performance, just a great vehicle. First time I've had strangers compliment my vehicle. Would definitely buy again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is just an incredible vehicle, very high tech, but easy to figure out. The stereo is awesome, love the subwoofer. Controls are very accessible. Voice command system works great. Smooth ride, don't even know you are going as fast as you are (yikes). Gas mileage not as good as I hoped, but it is all wheel drive. This car has many options that you would pay 10k more for vehicle. handling is incredible and steering response is nice</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Can connect iPod into stereo system and stereo is awesome. Color of lakeshore silver is beautiful. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drove high end MBZ and Lexus for decades. Bought the RL for the seat (bad back) and took what came with it. For 20K+ difference I'm more than pleased with the result. The RL is a dream to drive, and the cornering is amazing. The engine has all the power I need. I concur with all the positive comments seen here and have only one big squawk. I HATE THE STEERING WHEEL! It's not the wheel that's so bad even if it is too slippery, it's that it's loaded with so much stuff it looks like a game controller. The shift paddles are right in the way for a clean grip as are the telephone buttons which I don't use either. Remove that crap and sticky up the wheel and I'd give "fun to drive" a 10 also.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Feels safe. Love the keyless feature. Drivers seat is exceptionally comfortable for my back. It carves corners like a razor and stops on a dime. The Nav system is great as is the radio and the controls are well laid out. The fit and finish are exceptional. The cabin is very quiet. No V-8 needed!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Acura RL w/Tech Pkg. is truly a dream machine. Dynamically engineered, superb build quality, fit and finish, quality materials and technically ahead of its competition. The RL is the best kept secret of ?07. It goes beyond the ?Best Bang for the Buck?; this well crafted automobile has exceeded my expectations in every way. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The RL is a magnificent machine, and far and away the best value in its class. It is cram packed with cool technology and the AWD delivers amazing handling in all kinds of weather. Fit and finish are supurb. This car puts a smile on my face every day on the way to work each morning and tempts me to take the "long way" home each night. Highly recommended.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall comfort, AWD super-handling, navigation with real-time traffic. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The RL has been everything it was made out to be. Interior styling is excellent and instruments easy to see and use. Exterior is sleek with the exception of the standard wheels, kind of boring. The upgrade they offer cost $3000 and you have to go to 18" rims. Only knock I have.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I compared the BMW 5 series, Mercedes, Audi6 and Lexus 350. No comparison. The RL has SO many more features for the money it is no comparison. The RL is SOOO comfortable to drive. I got the tech package being a techie myself. I love the quality and ergonomics of the interior design. The V-6 has some punch but not like a V-8 (my only complaint). The AWD is simply awesome. The Bose 10 speaker stereo is unbelievable!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I enjoy owning the RL. It is very comfortable and easy to handle. Acceleration is mild for horsepower rating. It behaves as though it has turbo lag. Entry is awkward, seat and steering wheel take position when I get in the car rather than waiting until door is closed or car is started. Standard battery capacity is low. Have had to charge battery twice from sitting car with engine off trying to learn/program the computer navigation system. Fuel economy is good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car rides smooth and tracks the road very well, it feels like the tires have claws. Night lighting of the road is outstanding. The electronic stuff is just plain fun.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drive 120 miles per day R/T from Long Island to New Jersey. About 45 miles is on highways with traffic with about half during high traffic rush hour. Average speed about 40 mph. Gas mileage typically 22-23 mpg. On longer, non traffic trips 26 mpg. Never got less than 19 mpg. Car has 12,000 miles... no defects or repairs. Very comfortable, all the power you need, handles well, nothing to really complain about.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior comforts are great. Handsfree entry and locking, NAV system is awesome, sound system outstanding. Looks and handles great. Stiffer than a Lexus and no annoying Infinity engine noise. Closest feel is an Audi but without the 6 speed Audi constant shifting... try that in traffic before buying.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Truly have fallen in love with this car, because of it's intelligence. The german offerings do not have the creature sensitivity the Japanese can create. The driving experience includes more than just speed or performance. Integrated with it's performance is driver comfort and assistance. If you appreciate deep intelligence in design.....get this car and you won't want to ride in any other car when you go places.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Satellite radio/sound system. V6 w/natural turbo (VTEC) when needed. Superhandling AWD carves corners like nothing else ever experienced. It's truly aptly named. Nobody can touch you on off/on ramps. Active noise abatement, active lighting, powerful lighting at night, NAV smarts. Cerebral.</FAVORITE>
