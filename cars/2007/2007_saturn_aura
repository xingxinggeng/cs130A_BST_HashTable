<TEXT>OK so I've had this car for little over 2 years and have driven the heck out of it. I've had my share of minor fixes with the car...computer issues, remote keys not working, airbag lights coming on...etc. But I will say that over all this car has been very reliable and a great car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it used with 25,000 and I'm now at 65,000. I live in upstate NY and drive 60+ miles a day so the milage is adding up quick. I'm getting 30+ GPM on the highway which is great since that's most of my driving. I had "ok" tires" on it for winter and it still did great! I've plowed over 16"+ of snow and keeps going. I've hit a deer with it already and had it fixed. Turned front rotors once but that's from slamming on the brakes to avoid the deer LOL. My big thing was V6 with power and still GREAT gas milage! I've had enough of 4 bangers with no power. I'm sure this car will last 200,000 miles maybe more. WE'LL SEE!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Motor has power with great gas milage. I will drive it into the ground and get every penny out of it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall love this car. Did alot of research and test drives of various cars before deciding this was my dream car. Sometimes I have nightmares. I'll be taking it in for the 8th time for the service traction control light coming on. The dealer has tried something different each time including have the roving Saturn Enginer come out & determine that the header was put on wrong and needed to be rebuilt. That took car of the problem for about 5 months and now it's back. Very fustrations</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Telescoping pedals I'm 5'2". Heated seats and the power when I need to accelerate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Saturn 3 years ago and still love it. My Saturn is the fully loaded XR Bronze XR model and I have been stopped by strangers admiring the style of this vehicle. I've kept the mileage low and average 20 mpg city driving. Only complaint is recently the ESC service light activates at the slightest stop which causes the brake lights to stay on. Took it in for servicing which lasted less than a month and it is coming on again. I am hoping that this will not be a on going problem.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling of this vehicle is fantastic</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has a nice road presence, fun to drive... I wish that my 1st ('92 SC2) had the power of this 3.6L! The Formula-1 paddle shifters are nice when in a 'sporty' mood; I believe this is the same 6-speed transmission used in some BMW's (for those who didn't know- BMW does get 1 of it's 3 trans. models from GM). The Goodyear Eagle LS-2 tires (OEM) handle well enough. Once accustomed to the Understeer (all FWD's have it, RWD's have Oversteer), winding roads are fun, too. Bred from GM's German Car Group (Opel), it's a nice follow-up to the L300. Saturn Service Depts. treat me like a king. I've owned Fords, Chevys, 1 Dodge, 1 VW... I've been driving for over 30 yrs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned for over two years. No problems. Love the two tone interior, ride, handling, acceleration. My only complaint is with the city gas mileage. On the highway I can get 33 mpg. In the city where I do most of my driving I get at most 13 mpg, and I use every known method to increase efficiency. People who claim to get 18-22 in the city cannot possibly be right. I check my mileage at every fill-up and have never gotten better than 13 mpg. Other than this, the car is great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>All in all, a well balanced package of performance, practicality, and value. The 3.5 V6 has yet to leave me wanting for power while maneuvering in traffic, but the smooth 4 speed transmission to which it's attached is not the most willing participant in more enthusiastic driving. Handles well and rides comfortably. 70-80 mph freeway cruising with 2-3 passengers yields about 27 MPG at the pump, dropping to the lower twenties with more city use. Driver seat comfort is good with fully adjustable seat and tilt/telescoping wheel. Rear room and comfort are also good, but the abrasive plastic on the front seatbacks could leave shorts/skirt attired passengers with scraped knees if not careful.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable cockpit, wind rush and exterior noise well muted, good power/economy compromise. Great value for a car with 225 HP V6 and leather interior. Even with extra options like sunroof and remote start, no other competitor came close in price. 16K miles and no problems to report</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always owned Camry's and was a die hard Toyota driver. With price being an issue dwhen shopping for a new car, I test drove every make and model out there. I kept going back to the Saturn and test drove it 3 times. hands down quality and price won out and I choose a Saturn. It still smells like new inside and has been a great car and one that I plan on keeping for a while. The sleek looks and gas mileage are a very big added bonus. Pay attention Toyota because you just lost a customer for life! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Console, stereo/CD and awesome speakers. Great gas mileage and people are always asking me is that a CTS and I say no but it rides like one, because it is a Saturn.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm really trying hard to like this car but have had several issues since buying it. Transmission seal leak, steering coupling replaced, power window switch, rotors warp, continuing issue with service traction light going on then off while at high speeds. Passenger window wiper travels too far and stops directly in front of driver view creating rubber mark on windshield. Replaced blades 3 times $60 each time. Stock LS tires are lees than adequate in snow. Tilt steering somewhat poor quality. This is a beautiful car otherwise, heated seats work good, sound system good. It hasn't left me stranded yet! I will say this, up until 28,000 miles the vehicle ran flawless. We will see how it goes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove many different cars including the Altima and Camry to compare the noise and smoothness of ride. The Camry sport took the corners the easiest, but the Aura rode the smoothest. All in all these three cars handled almost the same so my decision came down to looks and interior. The Aura has by far the nicest dashboard setup and I love the 18 inch wheels. Car is a major head turner, and people are just drawn to the car while walking in parking lots.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior setup, 18 inch wheels, and chrome strip down the side of car as well around the windows add a nice touch and really stand out on the black paint. Also love the look of the blinkers on the side of the car. Minor things, but really add to the car. </FAVORITE>

It is fun to drive and now you?r e safe inside with side and front air bags. I think Saturn needs to advertise more about this wonderful car. Now I do by word of mouth</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at most of the competitor?s products over a 1 month period and kept coming back to the Aura. I wanted the XR but ended up choosing the XE. I got the XE fully loaded and it?s essentially the XR with a very few exceptions. I couldn't justify the extra $4K for 28 more HP and a 6 speed auto transmission. The XE performs very well in all areas. The build quality is excellent, the styling is eye catching, and the drive is wonderful. I'm back in a domestic automobile for the first time in over 10 years. If this is any indication of where GM is heading then it's a good sign. Think most fellow import buyers will feel the same if they give it a chance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Aura XE for two months now and I love it just as much today as the day I drove off the dealer parking lot. The ride is smooth and quiet and it has great pickup. The leather seats are the most comfortable I have ever had in a car. I looked at the comparable midsize cars, but with all features the same, none of them could touch the affordability of the Aura.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love my sunroof! The Aura also has a good sounding radio and the OnStar is a huge plus. The car handles really well on the interstate and around town.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently traded in my 2004 gas guzzling Chevy Silverado for the much acclaimed Saturn Aura. I kept reading glowing reviews about the Aura and decided to take one for a drive. I was extremely impressed. Visually the car is stunning. For my taste it is much more attractive than the Camry, Accord, or even some luxury models like Volvo. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I now have 10,400 miles on my car and it has been a reliable joy to drive. I get 30.7 mpg at 80 mph on my work trips to Orlando. The car is quiet and tight. The upgraded sound system is as smooth as the outstanding handling is. A year ago I might have laughed at an American car company competing against the Japanese on television but this car competes with them and the Audis and Volvos. For $22,000, I got a car that saved me $10000 in comparison to German cars and gets noticed on the road. Thanks America for building a car that I am happy to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Black with brown leather looks sharp. 18" machined wheels and low profile tires make it look like a European sport sedan, with a hint of true American muscle. Handling is superb - suspension is stiff, yet very comfortable (feels like a 5 series beemer). XE's engine provides plenty of power for a family car driver, who does not mind get around slower traffic on the highway. Much better value than Camry or Accord, and a whole lot more fun. First 500 miles I am averaging ~30 MPG on the highway and ~25 MPG in mixed 70% highway/30% city driving. Overall, one great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased the Saturn Aura XR after looking for the last 2 months at a number of vehicles. Saturn is comparing the XE to the Camry and Accord...but when I test drove the XR I found it more like an Infinity, Lexus or BMW. The performance that the Aura XR has is incredible for the price. My choice came down between the Infinity G35 and the Aura XR, and the XR was significantly cheaper for similar performance. The more I drive my new Aura the more I know I made the right choice. I love the look of the Aura and the performance is incredible. Saturn has upped their game in the Aura and I would reccomend the Aura to everyone</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the vehicle about four months ago as a cheaper form of transportation. We had owned an SUV prior. Overall the vehicle's appearence and quality seems good. The interior has a Audi-esc appearence but not Audi quality. It is not bad quality it could just have a little better materials. However the fuel milage has been disappointing. It actually is getting worse mileage than the Honda CRV it replaced. In mixed, conservative driving it is only getting about 21.5 MPG. Very disappointing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am absolutley thrilled with my Aura. Last year at this time, I never would have imagined owning a Saturn, but after test driving the Nissan, Toyota, and Honda, It won hands down. For the price I could afford, the car looked the best and was the most fun to drive. I purchased the chrome wheelcovers after I brought it home and it even looks better. You can't even tell they're not real rims! Overall I couldn't be happier and happy to see an American car company finally step up to the plate. Well done Saturn. Now if I can just get a picture with the car of the year trophy, it will be complete!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up this beauty on May 1, 2007, and have put 1100 miles on it to date. If you remove the badges from this car, you would never guess it is a Saturn. I purchased the XR model with the 2 tone Morracon brown leather and the Bronze exterior color. Everything works perfectly and I have found nothing to complain about so far. The 3.6 V6 with paddle shifters is really fun to drive and the power is awesome ! I tested many other brands in this price range before purchasing what I think is the best equipped and highest quality new car for the price. Good job Saturn! </TEXT>

<TEXT>My last 2 vehicles have been Honda Accords. Dependability and reliability of Honda is excellent, but it was the styling of the new Aura which attracted my attention. It was love at first sight and my test drive only served to confirm that physical attraction! I've had my XR for a week now. I absolutely love driving it and have received many complements on it! In fact, 2 friends are planning to visit the dealership to drive an Aura! It surely was the right move for me! Way to go, Saturn! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a wow car, The GM guys got it right on the 2007 XR. So much for so little, fantastic fit and finish, looks that blow away the foreign competition. Zero to 60 in 6.5 seconds, absolute quiet ride with a very sport tuned suspension. It will out do any car in any class under $36,000. This is the most complete car I have owned in my 70 years of driving. Keep it going Saturn because it's the best kept secret that America has. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The looks got me to the dealership on this car but it was the handling on the windy roads that sold me. I feel more like I'm in a European version of a Caddie than a Saturn. The gas mileage is proving to be as predicted. I'm not certain on the power yet but I suspect that the vehicle and I haven't finished adjusting to each other.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at the Camry, Accord and Ford Fusion. For the price the Aura cannot be beat in my opinion. Sure the interior is plastic, but you have to cut cost somewhere and it doesn't look that bad. In fact it works well for an everyday driver with kids.The car has power and handles well. Lots of rear head a leg room.The XM stereo is great. The car looks good and sporty for a family car. My friends and neighbors all like the car, but not all knew it was a Saturn. Most thought the car was $35k. For this car segment this car cannot be beat. The 3.6 sounds good on acceleration with plenty of power. 6 speed tranny works fine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I originally purchased an XE at the beginning of the month. I loved the car so much I wanted more. So, I used Saturn's exchange program and got the XR with leather seats. The XE is quiter and shifts smoother. The XR is quicker and sportier. I had cloth seats on the XE. The leather seats on the XR are much more comfortable. If you want a quiet, smooth, luxurious feel, the XE with leather seats is your car. If you want a sportier feel and the ultimate driving experience, go for the XR. I have owned at least a dozen cars. This car is by far the best car I've have owned for driving experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We absolutely love this car. The drive and comfort level is top notch. Quiet, sleek, stylish, and quick to boot. Gas mileage is superb. The only real complaint is on the rear interior design. Very difficult to see out of, especially when backing up. Extreme caution is recommended. Past that, there is a little cubby hole door, just left of the driver, that already won't close when opened. Just hoping that's not going to be the norm with the interior convenience features. Would absolutely recommend this car. Saturn truly did a great job on performance, ride and comfort. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After turning in a 2004 Caddy this car is lots of fun. Very surprised so far. Gas mileage in town is not good! Highway was much better. Only problem, rear of XR should have rear seat armrest and also a AC duct for rear A/C to get to! Minor additions but great value to rear passengers. Sound system is great! Only interior part that looks cheap is the interior door panels, other than that great car for the money. Can't compare that to anything out there.</TEXT>

Comfortable, well equipped in the interior, too much comfort for the driver and the passenger. The car is really great. If you feel it stiff on the bumpy roads, just check your psi, the tires might be more than 30 psi. Otherwise, the car is great.

<TEXT>I purchased the vehicle in January of 2007 based on its styling and fuel economy. I could not believe the features offered in the XR at the price offered. It's a Lexus or a Beemer, even looks like one but for much less. Also, the smoothness of the ride and the quietness as the car rolls along is unbelievable. GM, if you could make the XR a full hybrid, bye-bye Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorites in the interior of the car are the Moroccan leather seats, both driver and passenger power seats, the ease of operating the controls located on the steering wheel, and the adjustable pedals. I'm 6'2 and weigh 200, the car fits me like a glove.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was my first purchase of an American car. In the past, I avoided American vehicles because of quality concerns and lack of interior refinement. However, the Saturn Aura Concept immediately caught my attention when I saw it in 2005. I made a Black Onyx XE model my own in January 2007, and it continues to impress me several months later. It is easy to maintain, and I have had no reliablility issues at this point. The Aura offers a pleasant driving experience with very little wind or engine noise audible at normal highway speeds. The suspension is tuned well, giving a balanced yet sporty ride. Saturn succeeded in taking the Aura upscale. Most of my friends think it is a more expensive car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always been interested in Saturns, but finally I took the plunge and am blown away at how sweet this car is. Deluxe luxury, fantastic performance and a European high quality finish and fit make this by far the swankest auto that I have ever owned. I have been a die-hard VW fan for years, but between this and the Jetta, this presents way better value and quality for my money. Based on the Aura, we're definitely also replacing our next car with another Saturn product. These guys have turned their game on. Watch out competitors, Saturn is back in the game!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well folks I was thinking if I could just get my wife to try another bland midsize car she would give in and let me get the Jeep. So off to the Saturn dealership we go and pick out an XR for road test. My wife drives and after a couple of miles I see a smile..she says your turn to drive. We switch and I quickly realize just how great this car really is. I can tell you with complete honesty that the XR is without a doubt the complete package. If you're looking for a no compromise sedan this is it. </TEXT>

I stronly urge anyone looking for a fabulous car for just under $30,000 to race to their Saturn dealer and give the Saturn a try. You'll be just like me and many others, you'll have found a new love!

<TEXT> Because I average around 30,000 miles per year it was important to me that I got at least what the sticker said I would get on highway miles per gallon. For the first 2000 miles I have driven the car, I have averaged 30-32 miles per gallon on highway at 65-72 mph, around 1700 RPM'S. (sticker said 30 MPG Highway). Comfortable ride, handles well around curves. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Once you get over the fact that the Saturn Aura XR is not your typical "panache" import (i.e. Audi, BMW, Acura or Infiniti), then you will be pleasantly surprised by the performance, appearance, features and reliability of the Aura XR. This is GM's best shot at the imports. The car is very comfortable and enjoyable to drive, is loaded with amenities and actually shares the same quality "feel" as my previous Audis and Bimmers. This is a great car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, this has been a wonderful car. It is our 4th Saturn since 1997 and is the best so far. Ride is suprisingly quiet and smooth. Handling is "sporty" and with the longer wheel base takes the bumps in the road with little notice of the passengers. Workmanship is typical Saturn quality (this is a positive statement)and the only issue was OnStar didn't work out of the showroom but was resolved within a week of purchase. All in all, its Saturn's best to date and it turns heads (we purchased black on black leather). My wife and I argue over who will drive it, she wins during the week and I get it on the weekends.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a great car! I purchased a 2006 Nissan Altima in December of 2006 then saw the Aura. It was head and shoulders above my Altima and better than the '07 Altima. The Nissan went good-bye immediately. My Aura is smooth, quiet, and roomy. The styling stands out, even earning a "Cool" from my teen-age son. The build quality is better than the Nissan's I looked at as well as Camry, Accord, and Passat, something I'm reading in all the reviews I've seen as well. Saturn has a winner in the Aura. I feel like I'm driving a much more expensive car than what I paid for (base with no options for $20,000). Anyone looking for a classy mid-size sedan? Aura is the real deal!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the Saturn Aura XE. It had eight miles on it when I drove it off the lot. I was amazed and so happy that I had made this decision. The smooth ride, the classy interior and exterior and the economical gas mileage that this car has now given me is awesome. I've now got 1500 miles on it and wouldn't hestitate to tell anyone to go for it. Saturn Auras are the answer to your high priced Camrys, classy VW's, and yes, even have been told it looks like a MINI 300 M. Absolutley incredible. Wish I could find someone that has bought one in the Albany area in which I live, so we could e-mail one another and compare notes! All I can say is in three years I will be trading it in for a new Aura!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is not the typical Saturn. The handling is superb, the ride is a little bumpy with the sports package suspension. Wind and road noise is at a minimum. The four way stability track with four wheel anti-lock disc brakes makes a difference on slippery roads. With the adjustable pedals and 8-way adjustable power seats makes for finding the comfortable position easy. Just wish it had a memory setting on the drivers seat for multiple drivers. For fun you can put the car into manual and shift thru the six gears via the paddle shifters mounted on the steering wheel. If you are looking for a midsized 4-door sedan, do yourself a favor and test drive this car. Good to have choices!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Outstanding car. Has all the safety features I wanted, it drives great and is very comfortable. Nothing in its price range can compare. It is very often mistaken for imports or cars costing much more. The hard part may be getting shoppers into the showroom, but the car will sell itself if shoppers take a look and a test drive.

<TEXT>Thought I would never get anything but another CTS when my lease ran out, not so. Checked out the Camry,Fusion, Mazda6 and the Passat, the Aura XE had just about everything we wanted. We had to go with the XE due to the need for a lower payment. The XR would destroy all other rivals in almost all comparisons including the CTS. What a nice sedan at a great price. Quick and responsive with a real nice ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We got the leather interior with the heated seats and the convenience package with the remote start. These are a must if you get the XE. XM radio is stunning. Trunk size is huge.

<TEXT>Way to go GM. You got it right with the Aura. The Aura's styling is absolutely gorgeous. The ride is very pleasurable, as it enjoys the sporty tautness of a German car combined with an American interior made to be soooo comfortable. I feel great when I drive it. Many friends have commented on it's eye-catching styling which is complemented by the bronze pewter colour. I have purchased in the past 25 years a Ford Torino, Datsun B210, Toyota Corolla, Honda Accord, Pontiac Montana and Saturn Ion. In my opinion, the 2007 Saturn Aura rides like a sports sedan. You get a lot of car for the money. I am proud to be driving a car made in North America, which is as good as imports. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the quick acceleration, the wood trim interior, the ambient lighting and steering wheel, the comfortable sporty seats which hug you, the gorgeous exterior styling, the Saturn emblem on the trunk.

<TEXT>I traded a BMW 540i (V8) for this car. I am still in disbelief at how much better the Aura handles than my bimmer did. The BMW would win in raw power, if you really stomped on it, but for normal driving, the acceleration feel is the same and the Saturn takes curves like it is literally on rails. I bought the base model because we are forcing ourselves to be thrifty this year, but the beauty is that even the base model has enough features to feel like a much more expensive car. I tested the Camry/Altima/Sonata/Fusion, and this car drove much better, came with more safety/convenience features, and was cheaper (plus better warranty) than all of them. Great stereo too even in the base model.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling! I live on a mountain and there are lots of curves in my commute. This car is smooth and sticks to the road. Stereo, base model sounds great. ABS, traction control and all airbags are standard (ABS extra on the Fusion). The car looks good, even with hubcaps </FAVORITE>

Its steering is responsive, ride is not boaty and feels very secure. Lots of standard features for the money. Looks great, runs great. I now, also know what Saturn satisfaction is all about. If I was given the choice to buy all over again, I'd head right for Saturn and not bother testing the other cars I tested, now knowing what I know. The only thing I might do differently is, this time get that panoramic sunroof they offer. </TEXT>

When we get rid of the Ford 12 months from now, we will get another Saturn, either the Outlook or another Aura! This car handles better than my stepson's BMW 325i, and rides better.

The exterior of the car got me to the dealership, the interior got me to ask for a price, and the price sold me! This is a lot of car for the money and I would buy the car again if I had to do it all over again. GM hit a home run with this car.

I didn't like the Altima as much for steering, although the engine is at or beyond the Aura in some refinement aspects, and Camry for ride and road noise. The Aura is more quiet, has better steering feedback, and more tight suspension and seating. Only thing that needs attention is a rear center armrest, move high mounted stoplight to top of rear window, and improve quality of rear seat cupholder.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had my Aura XR for 2 weeks when some engine noise came up. The dealership could not figure out what it was for 2 weeks. It had 2k miles on it so exchanging it wasn't an option. Seeing as how I had it half the time and dealership couldn't fix it, I expected they would replace it for me. They chose to claim the rules were inflexible and offered instead to replace my engine. I'm not sure how I feel about this but I have no choice because if I wait for them to figure out how to fix this engine I may not get it back for weeks. In any case I really do love the car, they tell me no one else has had this problem and the car is so new they don't have any practical experience on this engine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>In any case, the did offer me a 60k mile maintenance plan at no cost to compensate me since my car has been in the shop 1/2 the time I've owned it.

<TEXT>Our Aura XR is our fourth Saturn, and shares garage space with an XK-E, TR3, and a '29 Ford hotrod. This car combines great performance, style, and reliability with super dealership support. The XR is a fine daily driver, but great for motoring trips. Quiet, really quick when using the Allison 6 speed paddle shifter in manual mode, and sticks to the road like no sedan we've ever owned. Directly compares to the Lexus ES but the Aura handles better. The Caddy 3.6 with VVT is silky smooth and hard to tell when it's running: the tach is necessary. If this car is indictative of the new models Saturn has in store, with their excellent dealerships the marque will be more popular than ever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When the time came to replace our Saab 9-3, my wife and I did some car shopping. After stopping at the Saturn dealership, we both agreed there was no need to look any further. We test drove both the XE and XR versions. In the end, we just couldn't pass up the OHC V6 & 6 spd automatic in the XR. Wow! What a car. Definitely not what has become known as the "typical" GM car. It drives smooth and handles very well while still absorbing bumps. The engine provides ample power and the transmission, while occasionally slow to respond, shifts smoothly. My wife loves the remote start feature. This car should be on every midsize car buyers shopping list. It's definitely worth a look.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had gone to the Saturn dealer to check of the VUE Hybrid, but staring at me in the showroom was the Aura. The car has stunning looks both inside and out. After test driving the Aura, I knew I had to own it. The Aura has been a great car. The steering is very responsive and the cars handles great. I only problem I have with the Aura is the steering wheel. First, I wish it would tilt. The Aura steering wheel is telescopic and even goes up and down. This is satisfactory, but a tilt wheel would have been better. The other problem with the steering wheel is that the driver controls are too small. Now that it is winter and I am wearing gloves, it is difficult to press the buttons.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If price, performance, and standard features are important to you, you owe it to yourself to drive an Aura. You'd have to spend around $45,000 to get anywhere near what you get as standard equipment on this American made car for around $25,000. I recommend the XR-the XE is around $1500 cheaper but at this price, go for the gold. If you are considering a Toyota, VW, or Honda, check this car before you make a mistake. The Aura puts them to shame. And I've owned one of each. If you think you can get a 6 cyl. engine,leather interior, sun roof, OnStar,8 speaker sound system,rear seat radio,18" alloy wheels,remote engine start and power everything for less, go for it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride is smooth as glass. You just glide to crusing speed. You can hardly feel it accelerate. Woosh, you're doing 60. Road noise is a thing of the past with this car.

The way the 18 inch wheels fill the wheelwells. Its been compared to an Audi A4 or a BMW. The 3.6 V6 has plenty of get up and go. No need to worry about getting onto a highway and the gas mileage is great for the horsepower. I was looking for a quiet highway car, the Aura is very quiet on the highway. The only complaint I have is the Midnight Blue is hard to keep clean, should have gone with the White or Silver.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Thus far I have owned a total of 17 new vehicles in my 56 year lifetime, 12 of which were foreign including VW, Subaru, Honda, Mazda(1 ford engine), and Isuzu. I have owned 2 Saturns. The first one a VUE V6 SUV which I purchased because of the Honda engine. The second is my Aura which I just purchased. Unlike the VUE it is all American which makes me very happy knowing that I finally found a domestic vehicle that is up to par with the foreign competion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife has had this car for two days, and I am so impressed, I had to write this. This is a great car. It is amazingly quiet, comfortable, has great vehicle dynamics and handling, and looks great. We also have a 2006 Corvette Z06, and a 2001 Z06, and I like to drive this Aura XE. The dealership experience was excellent. My sister has driven, or more correctly beaten, a Saturn for over 12 years. Now Saturn has added great styling, handling, and fun to the formula.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Before the Sky and Aura were released, I would have never considered buying a Saturn. With some trepidation I took the plunge and couldn't be happier. The European styling (both inside and out) is superb and its drive matches its great looks. I've received many complements from others driving far more expensive cars (who I think may be jealous). For its price, the ride is smooth, yet powerful when needed. The interior is very classy (wood trim, high quality rubber, excellent electronics design) and reminds me of an Audi. I've been told the exterior resembles a Lexus/Infiniti and completely agree. It has some flaws, but not many - an excellent car at an excellent price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard 6-cylinder, sporty front-end design, classy interior. Nice stock radio. Strong acceleration. Free year of OnStar. Folding rear seats (with plastic backs for rugged items), lighting of console/door handles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My girlfriend and I picked up an Aura XE first and we loved it so much I had to go back and get an XR for myself. There's not a lot on the road and we get people looking all the time and saying, "That's a Saturn?!?" The ride in these are so smooth and quiet that it feels we are driving in a much more expensive luxury car. I love the way how the car looks passing by because it looks like it is alot more money than it is and it stands out from the rest! Do not miss out on a great car if you are looking for a family and/or sports sedan by not considering an Aura. Drive one for yourself and you will like it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>On the way to buying an Audi, I was waylaid by the Aura and I love it. I have always bought Euro cars and I did again. The Aura is a German car made in our own USA. It has distinctive and classy looks. The performance of the XR is both very sporty and luxurious. It is very comfortable and the build and design quality are world class. It was also priced very very competively. This is a very compelling offer from GM that undoubtedly will capture new owners. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's been a long time that an American made car company has produced such a sweet car. We picked the ocean mist color. It's so cool. It has the chrome finish inside. The wood grain was a bit cheap looking. I would only change two things, improve the turning radius from 40 feet to 35 feet.The other thing put a lght in the glove compartment. Other than that she rides similar to my BMW 330CI. Not the same but stiff and very little leaning in turns.The power plant is the same as Caddy CTS. In conclusion I would recomend this hot car to anyone interested in a new fresh design and a car with get up and go yet still gets 29 miles to the gallon. And it is made in America by Americans.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have back problems after two painful surguries and the Aura was the only car that was really comfortable for me to drive in. The heated front seats are a major blessing for anyone disabled like me. The comfort of the ride is awesome. No side to side movement, and my back lets me know that this existed in all the other cars that we tested. The 3.6 litre engine with 6 speed transmission makes gear changes so smooth. This car is more like a limo in feel and ride. As much fun as a Porsche with its standard option of manual shifting with steering wheel mounted touch paddles to up and down shift. If you don't want that fun, you just use the great automatic transmission with the smooth ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Saturn Aura, especially the XR trim package, is an exceptional vehicle. The car does not feel like an American sedan. It has the look and feel of a European sedan, and it drives like that way as well. The suspension is taut but not too harsh. The cabin looks like it belongs in a luxury car. All this for a car in the mid-$20's. In short, I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can say Saturn really, finally, looked at design and style. This was always second to safety and reliability which is a good thing, yet you can't let these things go in a market flooded with competition. People want to feel good and enjoy what they drive in on top of having a safe and reliable car. This car has only been in my driveway roughly a week but feels great to have a car sonew it turns heads and makes people think,"what is that car and who makes that?" I love it so far and I'm very happy with what I purchased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a product of the "Baby Boomers" when hot cars were the craze. I grew up with my brothers and worked on cars and even dragged them. After over 10 years of driving a Grand Marquis I wanted something that I liked more than being practical. My first choice was the Mercedes and I opt out because of the cost of an extended warranty. Next stop was to the Saturn dealership. Love at first sight. Once I opened the door and saw the interior design I knew this was the car for me. The preformance is a plus. I like neat, organization, and luxury, all of which the Saturn XR offers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is really really fast for a car of its size. The cars paddle shift capabilities make passing very easy. The car's stability control feature is very useful and helps maintain easy control of the car even under harsh maneuvers. The car has minimal body roll and corners aggressively. Handles better than my Mercedes E-class and Lexus ES 350. The car has an input for an ipod and a very loud sound system. The 18 inch wheels make higher speeds very tolerable. Furthermore I have taken turns much too fast and have found the stability program useful. Buy the XR!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Puchased used last spring after months of research to save $. drives great, very powerful V6 with plenty of acceleration (0-60 < 6 secs). Highway miles above 27 at 70+MPH. combined driveing could be better I get avg. 20 when I go easy on the gas. handles great through curvy mountain highways. No problems thus far. my only complaint is the door lock sticks out right where my arm sit when I roll with the windows down. Sound system is excellent. Heated seats are great but could go all the way up the back rather than just lower lumbar. Exterior design is great, always turning heads. Looking forward to many years with this great car.

<TEXT>I went to the dealership originally to replace my 07 Pontiac G6 but I saw this car and I knew that was my new baby! It drives great, looks even better, has a ton of room and on top of that it gets great gas mileage. I get about 22 in town and 33 on the interstate. I love the power of the v6 too. The only flaw with it is that I have had to get my rotors turned twice already and the grey cloth seats stain very easily. Other than that, I really can't say enough about how much I love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 3.6 V6 certainly gives the driver a generous amount of power. Straight- line acceleration is fantastic. The six speed auto is OK, but it can be irritating when I slow to 45 to switch highways because it does not like to downshift. The handling is a different story. The suspension is too sensitive. Each time I hit a bump or dip, the car starts to go off in another direction. I have to grab the wheel tightly and pull the car back into a straight line. The stock tires don't help either. On another note, I am not a tall guy, and I have a hard time getting in and out of the driver's seat. I can only imagine how annoying it must be for people who are 6'+.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went looking in Sept of '06 looking for a Vue but the Aura XE was love at first sight. This awesome driving experience is something to look forward to every day. The 3.5L V6 performs most superiorly to its counterparts from Japan and Europe. When driving conservatively on the highway I could achieve economy in the mid 30's. A great joy to drive; economy and powerful performance plus ample amenities for an excellent price of only $22K. The Saturn Aura should alert educated buyers of the excellence and perfection that a roadster can be. If you are an import zealot, how sad to forego the experience of driving a real car for an inferior one. VW, Honda, Toyota and Subaru; no comparison.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Can not judge a book by it's cover. Sad to say the dealership was equally glad to see that I traded the car so they would not have to have it in their shop all the time. One month after I purchased the car I had ongoing problems with the vehicle. Nothing major just things like dead battery, passenger seat belt light remained on, vapor leak in rear light, remote start quit, keyless entry needed pads replaced, and rotors warped and still needed repair.

<TEXT>The car was originally a return from rental, so it was broken in when I bought it. But I love this car. Driving it is like an F-16 on wheels and just as sleek. Some people think I paid 50-60K and stare in disbeleif when I tell what I got for 22K. (Including tire/wheel warranty, bumper to bumper extended warranty and 3rd party remote- which the Saturn warranty covers) The in-town mileage is low but the highway mileage is outstanding. I typically get 35-40 MPG (at around 60) Kia & Hyundai eat your collective hearts out. Because of the high safety rating, insurance cost is very low. But why doen't GM advertise it more?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was always impressed with Saturn's performance, reliability and design, but felt their interiors wre cheap looking and sparse. The 2007 Aura is just the opposite. The interior is tight, quiet, and luxurious and only seen on more high priced luxury cars. The 3.6L engine with the 6 speed transmission is quick, responsive and fun to drive. Saturn has a winner here and foreign car owners should check out this car. It is priced $2000-$4000 cheaper than is competitors and has more standard features than most.

<TEXT>This car is very quiet. I purchased the base car in the Ocean Mist. I got a great deal due to being a current owner and a GM supplier. The lighting and the LED guages are super. For $10.00 per month you get OnStar turn by turn navigation on the radio controls. At 225 HP your not short on acceleration. The car is quite handsome even in base trim. I owned a 2004 Nissan Altima V6 before and I must say that this car is a tad better. Check out the paint colors. The Ocean Mist looks blue, green, and grey depending on the lighting.

<TEXT>I just bought a 2007 Aura XR, and I absolutely love it. I had a VUE, and loved it, until I got my Aura. Saturn is doing so well, I'm convinced their cars are the best value. On top of it all, insurance rates are low with Saturns!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased an Aura XE as my first car (all the other's had technically been Dad's) and I couldn't be happier with my choice. The black with tan leather is incredibly sharp looking and the exterior design is sporty with class. It drives smooth as butter, and the interior design reminds me of many luxury European cars. I would highly recommend this car for anyone looking for quality and class at a decent price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great interior design (especially the accented lights), high-quality leather, smooth shifting, strong pick- up, sporty look, free 1-year OnStar.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased the Saturn Aura about a month ago, and it is an amazing car. It is very smooth on the road and easy on the eye. It very easily blends in with all other luxury cars. It stands apart from other cars in its class including the Honda Accord, Pontiac G6 etc. If a Honda Accord or other car in the mid $20,000 range is something you are looking at, I would strongly consider the Aura.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bar none, the exterior. Very classy look. Leather interior, power seats, heated seats, XM radio, spacious, great interior design</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After extensively researching/testing alternatives in this class, we skeptically decided to stop and test the all new Saturn Aura. We were shocked by the value as well as the sporty driving dynamics. We have approx 1500 miles on the car and are still impressed with the comfort, interior quietness, styling, and overall package. Mileage is mid 20's with mostly mixed driving. After owning Hondas, we feel that GM has finally delivered a competitive product at an approx $2-3K discount. Would highly recommend checking this out before purchasing another vehicle in this class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Upgraded stereo, OnStar, and heated seats. Nice touch with LED lighting in interior. Styling is refreshing for GM product and looks upscale.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have not purchased an American car in years. I am stunned by the fact that this Bronzed Pewter Saturn Aura XR is such a great car. I traded in a very fast 2004 Peal White Nissan Altima V6 SE which in my estimation is one hell of a car. The Aura in Bronze looks like a full sized Audi, goes like a scalded cat, has 18" wheels, and GM leased it to me with a residual value of 55%. That's Honda resale territory, and if I were you I would run, do not walk, to your local Saturn dealer. Kudos GM.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Cadillac 3.6 engine is as fast as my 3.5 DOHC Nissan Altima SE. The six speed auto with steering paddle shifters rocks. The car looks like an upscale Audi and the price I paid was ridiculously low.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I already put 3200 miles on my XR, and must say this car gets more fun everyday. The handling is great, as is the acceleration. I get lots of curious looks from people, trying to work out what kind of car it is. I don't think that will last long, because when the word gets out about this car, Saturn will sell a ton of them. I traded in a Mercedes Benz for mine, and I had a few people raise their eyebrows when I said I had gotten a Saturn. However, nobody questioned my descion once they saw it or drove it. Great job Saturn!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned a VUE. I went in for an oil change at my local dealership and saw the Aura in the showroom. As I was sitting in the car checking out all of the fancy styling, the salesman asked if I wanted to take a test drive. After about an hour, he told me to take it home to show my husband. Well, the manual shifting on the steering wheel along with the performance and comfort sold him. We went back to the dealership and bought the fully loaded beauty on the showroom floor!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Aura for one week and I love it. I purchased the XR model fully loaded in Bronzed Pewter. It looks very classy, and the Moroccon brown leather is very sharp looking. You have to see it for yourself. The stereo is nice, and I like the controls on the steering wheel. The rear seat audio controls w/2 wireless head phones are nice too. No more fighting for a radio station w/the kids. The adjustable pedals are a must for short people like me, and I love the auto climate control and remote start. Just go and test drive one! You'll see how quiet it runs, yet how powerful the engine is. People are talking to me at red lights asking me about it! They can't believe it is a Saturn. Love, love, love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>It looks like Saturn will have a huge hit on their hands with the new Aura. From the ouside, the styling is just right, mixing traditional sedan lines with a contemporary edge. I purchased the XR model for the 3.6 V6 and 6 speed automatic. The performance is above average with very good off the line torque and smooth highway passing. If the public testdrives these cars before making a lemming-like decision to buy a Toy-onda, there's a great chance they'll buy the Aura. By the way, my maxed-out Aura cost almost 3 grand less than the V6 Camry.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought a fully loaded Aura XR. First and foremost, the car is very sexy looking. I bought the black on black leather all chromed out. Sitting on 18" rims, Yes, I said 18" rims, the car is definitely an eye catcher. The car has alot of pep and really moves. The car handles like a dream with a solid feel chassis. It really feels like a very exspensive luxury car when you take it for a drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far this is the best car I have ever owned. Very responsive and it handles more like sport coupe than a sedan. The best feature however is the styling. It just looks cool, and when you step inside, it remains impressive. The first Saturn Ii owned was a '94 when I was in college. I liked the car and the buying experience, but the cars were to plain Jane. I drove an Accord until this, and hopefully I'll stick with U.S. manufacturers from now on. If you give Saturn a chance, you're going to love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have the first one on the road here in MD. Berry Red, tan interior, 3.5 litre engine, sunroof and package with additional electronics. Well, one week later and it's still a great ride! Tight handling, quiet cabin and great looks. Wish it got the fuel numbers the Dodge Caliber gets, but hey, I have more power to boot. Quick take offs are indeed that. No complaints here. I drove most of the comparable cars by Ford/Mercury, Toyota, Honda, GM, ect...this is the best of the best for me. Drive one and enjoy the ride. Saturn got it right.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First one on the road in MD. This car stickered at $21,775 (base model) and is worthy of competition with cars costing twice the price. Style (I bought the Berry Red), comfort and ride are second to none. This is Saturn's finest hour competing with the imports. I test drove Mercury Milan, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima and Maxima, Cadillac CTS and Pontiac G6. Take all of the best qualities of each and put them into a sleek, eye catching style and you have the Aura. Test drive the others you're thinking about and then drive the Aura and see. It was worth the wait. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The driver seat is uncomfortable for me at the lower level. It need to be improved for 5'3" and below and the gas pad need to be a little closer because I feel like I'm on top of the steering wheel which is not good if in an accident. Getting out is a problem unless you want to adjust the seat everytime. The seat has caused back problem for and I have always had bucket seats but the seat isn't back friendly. The doors swing out too far but I understand this is for long legs and short legs just have to adjust. The armrest need to be longer for short arms. Even with it extending it is not comfortable.

<TEXT>After seeing the 2007 Aura won the "North American Car of the Year" award I thought "How can I go wrong". I traded in my 2003 Chevy Impala and in a year have had the car in for service 5 times. The second day I had the car I ended up having it towed into the service center because the transmission was missing and speedometor was bouncing around. Ended up being a speed sensor switch had to be replaced. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Saturn in over 10 years, and while I love the product, I am kind of disappointed in this car. I was told the MPG was better than it has been (lucky if I get 19 mpg both street/hwy) and have had little things going wrong on it from day one. The OnStar was leaking water in when I washed the car, the stereo jammed CDs in it, now the AM doesn't work and the OnStar is cutting out during phone calls. The front bushings are squeaking on turns and bouncing. It has a lag when getting on the freeway, seems to take a few hiccups to get up to speed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior leather, the sun roof and very good air conditioning system. The stereo is nice when it works, the OnStar the same. Seats are comfortable for us short people, has a sleek look, digital display with messages regarding oil, temperature, gas, etc..helpful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle due to Consumer Reports 2007 article. However,they are completely wrong about this car! I bought this vehicle in November of 2007, and not one week later, the car had to be brought back in for work. One month later, the same thing. They had to replace the paneling inside, replace the heater coil, and try to figure out why when I had my cruise control on, it would go from 70 to 78 going up hills. However, as I was told, it is stated on the Saturn description that this is normal. Really? I figure it is because they have no idea why the cruise control was not working.The next thing is the MPG. What a joke!!! I average, with going normal speed, 60-65, maybe around 21-22</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car for two weeks and I already have had two problems with it. First, a tire blew out ten minutes after leaving the lot. Then, I had to take it back because the rotors had to be re-surfaced. The car had only 392 miles on it. Now, the steering is 'bouncy' when I drive over 60. If I hit a bump, the steering wheel turns in a different direction and I have to grab the wheel with both hands to keep the car from getting away. This can't be normal, can it?</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best car we've ever owned. While completing a dealer-generated survey a short while back, there were no defects to report and that is still the case. The title of this review "I can't believe this is a Saturn" does not reflect our own words. A good friend, before getting into his Camry asked, "Is that yours?" He asked us to keep him informed. If reliability holds up, he's getting one. We have 12,500 miles and counting and absolutely nothing wrong. That was not true of our previous Toyota, which broke down twice in the first year and our Chrysler, which did likewise. Fuel economy is excellent (28.5 overall, the steering is taut, the ride perfect and the acceleration amazing!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second review of the Aura and probably can be considered a long-term review. I leased the Aura in late October of 2006. After 16 months of ownership and about 23,000 miles on the odometer, I can safely say that I have found a very nice car. I have lots of friends who own Japanese built Camrys and Accords, and I have hitched rides in all those models. None of them come close to the Aura on Interstate manners. It is an excellent workhorse on the wide open roads and is amazingly silent at high speeds. I average 30 mpg hwy and 23 city. I have even done a 550 mile, 8 hour stretche in the North-East and a 450 mile non-stop no refuel stretch as well. Cannot complain about anything.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent interstate manners; slient cabin, roomy trunk; OnStar; XM; very nice acceleration - even at high speeds; good gas mileage for a V-6; Value for money features - heated seats; sunroof; power seats all for under 23K.</FAVORITE>

I average 2-3 years on a car.The ride it the best feels like a BMW sport sedan. Comfortable and has style. I would have prefered the simulated wood trim to the silver interior trim but it is clean. Radio is great. Not bad on mileage 22-26 around town, 25-30 on highway. Very quiet ride for a $24K car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 4 months, I still love this vehicle. Pick up on acceleration is amazing. I have received many comments from people who think it is a $35,000 plus car and are amazed when I tell them it is a Saturn. I have learned to use all of the features and it just makes the experience better. I have seen Ford's Synch option in operation and OnStar has it beaten by a mile. What would I add? I am lazy, and I still like the idea of the combination keyless entry I used to have. But I would not give up the Saturn for it. Period.</TEXT>

However, there are three areas worth consideration: 1) it is very difficult to pull out of the front seats while exiting the vehicle, (2) the front doors swing out so wide it is extremely difficult to reach the handle and close the door, 3) while backing out there is a major problem seeing what is behind you when you look over your right shoulder (blind spot between right rear window and back window). </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Aura handles the mountain roads like a good sportscar, comfort is up there with a BMW and better than a Lexus 3 series. Performance is unbelievable for a 3.6 L V6 as I am getting 0-60 at 6.0 sec. and 60-100 in under 8 sec. Mileage has continued to improve with the miles (over 14000 now). My last road trip was 910 miles on 30.08 Gal which is 30.25 MPG. Great ride, great handling and great fuel economy. Oh The onboard computer is putting my required oil changes every 6000+ miles which is great too. With remote start, Lots of HP, A 6-speed with paddle shifters, sound absorbing glass and steel, heated seats, 18 inch alloy wheels and low profile Goodyears, and under $25K you can't miss.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Suspension tune, engine power, paddle shifters, seats, and the thrill I get every time I get in it and go, even if it is just a mile to the grocery store. Most fun I have had on a mountain road since I sold my '72 240Z.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Saturn. I upgraded from the Ion as it had no traction in the Michigan winter. First off, I love the look and feel of the Aura.I get a lot of compliments. Unfortunately just like my Ion it has substandard glass. Both cars within 4 months of purchase a small pebble caused a instant chip then crack all the way across the windshield. No problems with replacement windshields from outside companies. Biggest complaint is that the sticker said 24/30 mpg. At first the best I got was 24 mpg with 100% highway. And it has gradually gotten worse. Now I'm averaging 17 mpg and the dealer only can say:"Scanned ENG No Codes Unable to verify concern" so tough luck. This is my last Saturn.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning the vehicle for 6 months and having put less than 5,000 miles on the odometer, I have to say that the build quality is poor to say the least. Both of my underdoor plastic rocker panels are separating from the body creating large gaps thru which the fasteners and road surface can be seen. Neither dealer nor Saturn Customer Service have any fix. Both say the problem is occurring on other Auras. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Selected over other upscale model imports for features -in particular the high output engine running on regular, and fold down rear seats for my bicycle. Wanted a good handling car as mountain roads are driven daily, and it has lived up to this wonderfully. Selected over VW Passat- better looking exterior & interior. After 30K miles car is running well, but I had an issue with front strut rattle that took too long to resolve. Finally replaced last week after much insistance. Ahh quiet ride now I expected.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Aura XR (black with tan leather) back in Aug. and have almost 5K miles and zero problems. It is a car with a smooth ride, smooth engine (very little vibration when idling), and I am amazed at how it keeps gliding after you let up on the accelerator. It just does not slow down. Speaking of not slowing down, the car is fast! The paddle shifters are a nice feature to add to the performance fun. I really love the amount of car I got for the money. I still cannot believe is is a Saturn. Even some of my co- workers were surprised. My gas mileage has been improving as well. My average is up around 24 mpg with mostly highway driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the Saturn Aura XR model for about 2 weeks and I just love it. I traded in a 2002 Lincoln LS for this car and I would rate this car better then the Licoln. It is fun to drive and very comfortable. It is white with the black leather interior. I have not used the paddle shifters as of yet, but I am looking forward to it. The gas mileage is better then the Lincoln so far. I am getting about 25 miles to a gallon in mixed driving compared to the 19 to 21 with the Lincoln and I can use regular fuel not premium. If anyone is looking for a fun car this is the one.</TEXT>

The TAP-shift auto-manual is neat and fun to play with. The seats are comfortable. It handles crisply, like a German sports sedan. The ride is firm but not harsh.

<TEXT>I've been test driving cars for months now and taking the wheel at many varities of autos. The Aura was by far my favorite, so I took the plunge the other night after seeing the massive rebates put out. I have a feeling I will not regret it. I have a grey/black leather combo with multiple add on features (including the Panoramic Roof) and have loved every mile. It's quiet, feels sturdy and tight on the road. The mileage is OK, but it's a V6! The exterior is fierce with the alloys and leds. I love the interior lighting and read-ability and user friendliness of the panels. If you're going to do a midsized sedan, do it right and get an Aura fully loaded for less than a mediocre Camry/Accord.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven BMWs since 1992 and I thought I would never buy an American car. I saw an Aura at a picnic, parked along the side of the road and I thought it looked liked an Lexus. I couldn't believe it was a Saturn. I drove down to the dealership on Sunday and owned my new 3.6L XR, fully loaded Aura on Monday. I continue to hear from people that they can't believe that a BMW enthusiast could switch to Saturn--but it only takes one ride and a price difference of over 20,000 between the two cars to convince everyone that this was a wise choice. I'm impressed with the comfort, quiet ride and accessories. There are more accessories available than I could get in a BMW 5 series. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my XR new. went to buy a BMW 328i and left with the Aura. I love almost everything about the car including, XM radio, OnStar, sunroof, rear audio system and quality leather. My biggest 2 complaints are the 6 speed auto needs to be reprogrammed as sometimes it takes too much effort to downshift. Second the mixed gas mileage is terrible. 16-17 mpg in mixed driving. However, if you look at the price verse what you get overall it is the best sedan on the market. I would recommend.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am revising my earlier review of a 9.0 overall rating. My XR underdoor rocker panels (plastic) are beginning to pull away from the car body (steel) creating a 1/4 inch gap and exposing the rocker panel fasteners.

<TEXT>It is a powerful, smooth, great- handling sedan with great performance. It is rock-solid and very quiet inside. The interior design is very attractive, although it becomes bland as you live with it. The comfort of the front seats and the quality of the interior materials is lacking, especially the cheap plasticky center console. I keep expecting it to just break off its mounts. The seats also seem to have a certain amount of unpleasant rocking on thier base -makes car feel cheap. Sound system is excellent. Exterior styling is nicely upscale, and I like my massive rims.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a review right after we had bought this car. Basically, it said that the car was great. Now that I have had the car for over a month, I am revisiting my review. The mileage on this car stinks. In city drive (basically home to grocery storer, etc.), the car gives 17 miles to a gallon. That is less than the 10 year old Mercedes E320 that I had (18 miles to a gallon) and less than the 10 year old Toyota 4 Runner that I have (18 miles/gallon for a V6). I don't know what GM is thinking, making a supposedly state of the art car with a mileage less than current day SUV's. I guess one reason is that the car weighs a bunch (it is heavier than the Toyota 4 Runner and almost the same as an E320)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great looking car and so many people don't recognize it so they ask. The car is extremely quiet and rides like a luxury car. It is heavier than the competition but that weight makes it feel substantial on the road. Considering its features a comparable Altima or Camry would be over $30k and neither is as rare or as good looking as this car. The controls are all logically placed and the stereo is top notch for this class. If you don't want to be a follower and want a fast family sedan that stands out this is a good choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Saturn XR with 5000 miles on it, but it was in 100% perfect condition. It has features I would only expect on much more expensive cars, like electronic traction and ride stability control. It has a six speed automatic with paddle shifting on the steering wheel, which is fantastic for mountain driving. This car accelorates better than a 328, corners better than an Altama, and rides better than a Camry. Surprise is that it costs so much less than any of them. There is just to much to talk about here, let me just say that if you want performance, looks and ride like a $35K car and you like German auto engineering, but don't want to spend over $27K, then the Saturn XR is for you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature wouyld have to be hte paddle shifters for the 6 speed transmission. I put the shifter in manual mode when I drive in the mountains.

Cars like this will keep me in the GM fold from now on. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car, an Aura XR, is provided by my company so this is an unbiased review. The car is "nice" but devoid of personality. On the highway, a lot of road noise finds it way into the cabin, and around town a lot of engine noise and vibration can be heard and felt. Handling is ok, but no better then a lot of cheaper subcompacts and most mid sized sedans. After playing with the seat, steering and pedal position controls I have found that it is not possible to find a comfortable driving position. I cannot drive the car more then 30 minutes without my entire body aching. Fuel economy is nowhere near what I expect, I have a 2006 Vue which has more power and gets 2-4 more mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is incredibly quick considering it weighs in at 3700 pounds. Handling is superb as is braking. Transmission shifts so smoothly (perhaps the computer is smarter than old technology) and the ride is incredibly quiet, probably due to the sheet metal and the construction of the windshield. Interior is finished so very well although the rough plastic might leave something to be desires. The trunk is huge and the back seat folds down for extra space. The ride is firm, perhaps firmer than many would expect given the car's size and weight. The radio is great and the satellite stations really enhance the selection and the sound. A beautiful car with so many standard features included.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine performance is great (if it can be chipped, the horsepower can be rasied to 270; let's not forge that this is a Cadillac engine); braking, handling and appearance are superb.

<TEXT>I looked at a lot of cars before choosing the Aura XR. No other car could compare to the XR in this price range. In order to find a comparable car you need to add at least $5,000 to the price tag. This car has awesome performance. Unlike a lot of the competitors products you do not have to be running at redline RPM to feel the power of the car. This car has power to spare at any RPM. The six speed transmission is fantastic and a lot of fun. The transmission is crisp but not jarring. The paddle shifters are a hoot. I have gotten a lot of compliments on the styling of the car. People just can not believe that it is a Saturn. Give the Saturn XR a try. This one is a keeper.</TEXT>

The car perform very well - particularly on the highways. It is fun to drive and the engine seems to always have some juice left in it no matter what speed you are driving at. Ask a Camry to beat that. Road noise is minimal, and the car steers beautifully on curvy interstate roads. I enjoy my drives on the open road and have clocked 17k miles in 9 months without a whimper.

Smooth acceleration, quiet precise shifting and a very enjoyable ride. The leather seats are some of the most comfortable I have experienced.The climate control system keeps the cabin very comfortable even during a long drive on a 97 degree day. The 18" alloy wheels and Goodyear Eagle Touring tires provide exceptional handling and a quiet smooth ride. Fit and finish is taken to a new level.

<TEXT>I have been eyeing Aura's since they first came out. I decided to buy it for my wife even though she did not think she needed it. Two days later she loves it. I got the special edition package with the 18" wheels, Moroccan Brown leather, steering wheel controls and upgraded stereo. If the car would have been for me, I would have gotten the XR, as I am more of an enthusiast then she is, but I still love driving it. The build quality seems so tight and it is very quiet on the road. I find myself making excuses to go out just to drive it. As a 30+ year employee, I am very proud we finally made a car like this.
