<TEXT>Great overall car. Most people are surprised when I say it's a Saturn. Also surprised when I say it's exactly the same as the Chevy Cobalt SS. A very unique, rare and special car. There were only about 530 Redlines produced for 2007. Fuel efficient, fun to drive, and great acceleration on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had a continuing problem with a mold smell (and actual mold growing) from the engine compartment into the interior cab. I've had it in for service twice and the third time today. They are trying to push "environmental" issues as the cause but I cannot believe every ION in Florida has mold issues under the hood. I am curious if any other users had this same problem</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car because, at the time I thought my 2003 had been ruined by a quick oil change company. The engine died at 150k. The dealership offered me 1k for the dead car to buy a 2007. I did and regretted it from day one. The engine on the 07 died at 52k miles. I had 2 steering replacements the first costing over 800 dollars. The trunk bar broke almost after a month. The car sounds like its ready to break in half when you hit an average sized bump. The transmission was really quirky when accelerating. The interior stained way to easily and was cheap. There was a constant chirping sound from the front wheel area that would get fixed and happen again not long after. I'm out of space now. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The service team. I got to know them really well :) Nice guys who had to put up with this particular piece of garbage. It was a nice looking car, thats really the only positive thing I can say about it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When i first learned to drive when I had my drivers permit my mom had a 2004 Saturn Ion 2, so I am familiar with the performance and drive of the vehicle. I love the way the car handles, smooth drive, and no noises. One thing I have noticed that I am not fond of is the MPG it seems to get. I had a 2001 Chrysler sebring Conv. with a 6 Cyl engine... it seemed that I got more MPG with that vehicle however it could be due to the fact that in the ION I dont notice when I am driving faster so I feel the need to push the gas harder. I'd say for a 20 yr old college student its a great car for the money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is the way the car handles and how easy it is to drive. The performance of the car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car when my 1991 Dynasty caught fire, I wanted something economical since I was driving 52 miles one way to work, I wanted a moon roof, fog lamps, tilt steering, power windows/locks, cruise, XM radio option and On Star option. This car had it all. It was affordable and came with a reasonable price tag. I have a few minors issues with the alarm system shorting out, Saturn Service Guys are the best.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the instrument panel being in the center, I did not think I would when I first test drove the car but I quickly became accustomed to it. I have a place to put GPS so it does not have to stick to the window. I love the 33 miles per gallon gas mileage average.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has been nothing but trouble for me, in the 1yr of owning it I have had to replace the headlights (apparently they had cracked and there was about a cup of water in each), the electrical system is very touchy (not fun having your seemingly brand new car stall at a light) and to put the icing on the cake my right side mirror fell off, no I did not hit anything, it simply fell off while driving.. Also it gets no where near the estimated gas millage, I might as well be fueling a truck for as much gas as this car eats up. It will take a lot for me to buy from Saturn again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design is very nice for an entry level car, I do enjoy the aux outlet, and I like how the odometer is over to the side rather than right in front of you </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>I Love my saturn</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I am currently looking into a 2nd car for my hubby. We both love it and we are seriously considering getting the exact same car, same year: used of course as it has been a year and a 1/2 since we bought it. We bought a demo so it had a few hundred miles on it when we got it & it came with a good warranty. We really feel it is a wonderful car. I like the idea that the car isn't going to ding up & that the car in a few years will still look as nice as it does now. There are some minor issues which I see from other reviews that has bothered other drivers too. More on those later in my review. I do like the center instrument panel & the stereo especially. everything is really easy to use.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>it is good mileage it is very attractive on the inside & out love the cubbyholes & Onstar no major problems not covered by warranty so far I agree that if you live in a snowy or hilly area like we do you get snow tires, even my dad who has a '07 manual transmission astra said the same thing. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I orignally purchased this car for one of my kids, but needs changed and I've ended up driving it. It's a nice basic vehicle. It has adequate power and handles nicely, although the traction control doesn't deal with deep snow as well as it should. Gas mileage is pretty good, about 23-25 mpg in the city and up to 35 mpg on the highway. It provides reliable, economical transportation. Certainly deserves a better rating than the Edmunds Editors gave it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the stripped down version of this car (manuel transmission and windows) for 12500 brand new and so far its been worth every penny. 30000 miles later it still runs great and gives me no problems. At 20000 the change oil light went on and stayed on thru 2 oil changes but it evenually went off. The interior is a tall persons dream as the front seats go back extremly far, making it very comfortable (im 6'5) The milage is constantly around 30mpg. The only downside is the lack of acceleration in the car. Even is a standard you cant beat a SUV of the line. If you want a simple no frills car that is reliable, go with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car as my first new car @ age 23 and have never had an issue. The first winter (in Maine) the tires were fairly new but it did give me some trouble on hills and with stopping. I've liked a challenge but the 2nd winter I got studded snow tires mounted and the car went like a tank. 6-8 in of snow on a non-plowed highway and I was braving through without a care. Practically plowing myself. I did have an issue with snow building up in the wheel wells but who wouldn't. Overall, car has been great. Good fuel econ and nice sporty car for summer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After somebody cut out in front of me and my 10 year old used car got smashed up, I applied some of the insurance money towards a new 2007 Saturn ION. The Saturn dealer let me have it for under $12,000 and I've been happy ever since. It came with cold AC, a decent radio with CD player, 1 year of FREE OnStar service, and dark tinted windows. It drives well, has pep, and it cruises at 80 so well that it feels like you're going 60. I've put almost 19,000 miles on it in 17 months and it's been a very good car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is actually very nice to drive in the summer (or places that do not get more than a few inches of snow a year). It is great on fuel. I drive it about 3,000km a month. However saying that, I live in Southern Alberta this car is horrible to drive in the winter. It can get stuck in as little as 3 inches of snow with a slight drift. I have had this car for 2 winters now, one not finished yet and I have had to call road side assistance 3 times to get it unstuck and had to push it out about 30 times it high centers easily as well. In winter the only redeeming quality it isn't to heavy for 2 to push it out. Snow tires a must and you'll still have problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I find this Ion to be an excellent car. Keep in mind it is not a luxury car. Basically a no-nonsense, reliable vehicle. I had owned 2 Saturns previous to this one & have found all 3 to be reliable, transportation, & based on cost per mile I couldn't be more satisfied. Unfortunately the polymer exterior panels were dis-continued in 2007. That was one of the main reasons I chose to buy Saturn. They are tough , don't rust or corrode & the paint finish is as attractive after 5 years as it was when new. Not to say these cars are flawless. I have encountered a few minor problems. None that ever put the car out of service & all were repaired under warranty to my satisfaction.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Polymer exterior panels retain good looks & are tough. Love the center Instrument panel display. Excellent performance & gas mileage. Only car I'm aware of that has the extendable console arm-rest & it'll be hard to get along without when I trade this car. Great bang for the buck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got an 07 ION sedan 2.2l automatic alloy wheels spoiler sunroof and was excited. I loved the car for about the first 6 months then realized some of the poor quality that went into it. The seats are extremely cheap. I only have 22,000 miles on the car and the fabric in the driver's seat is coming loose. Also the light grey fabric throughout the interior stains extremely easily. This is more apparent as you own the car for a year at least and anything will stain the seats/carpet. At 18000 miles the driver window fasteners failed and the window was loose inside the frame. The sunroof creaks when you go over a bump or change in road incline (like up a steep driveway). Engine s great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to defend this car. Have had mine for 14 months and with the exception of a tiny bit of wind noise (Saturn will fix it) the car is great. No, I am not in any way affiliated with Saturn or GM. In fact, this is the first American car I have owned new since 1979. Folks, it's a $20,000 car, not a $40,000 SUV. When I drive well, I get an avg city/hwy of 33mpg. I use only good gas-Union, Shell, Chevron, etc. I change the oil every 3,000 miles no matter what the OnStar report says. I keep the tires inflated properly and clean the air filter every 6 mo (dusty area) Frankly, I was very happily surprised as I have been very soured on American cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car brand new in Toronto, and drove it from Toronto to California, up the coast to Oregon, and all the way to Phoenix. I have put 39,000km on it in just over a year. In the first 6 months of owning it I had to have the entire electrical system replaced. 2 months later I had to have to accelerator and brake system replaced. The starter had problems after one year, and once it wouldn?t start at all for quite a few hours. AAA will not unlock this car if your keys are locked inside. They told me that this models electrical system is too delicate. The fuel economy is below average and far below the EPA estimate. Overall I am sure you can tell that I am very disappointed in this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car in Dec 2007 for a birthday gift to myself. Ii am 19 and had never owned a new car. Well let's just say if I could go back and get a different car I would! At 3000 miles my car was in the shop 2 times for clunking while doing u turns, which they replaced the tire well and it still continues today, and also a chirping in the tires. They tell me there is nothing wrong with it, also still going on today. I have 8000 miles on my car & I have been to the shop 9 times for the reasons above and now clunking in the back of the car as well as brake clunking. My rotors have been replaced for being warped after 2000 miles. and the tire well, also things have been falling off the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is & always has been a serious junk. Multiple problems: shifter (possibly clutch) problems, floor heater never worked, doesn't get cool enough for tx summers, horrendous gas mileage, climate control panel gets extremely hot when controls used, screeches when it starts, rattles when idling, major power loss in fifth gear! You can't jump on an interstate in this heap! Warranty you say? No I'm just a stupid woman & need to get my foot out of it to shift it. But I've met several owners with the same issue! Other other warranty work can be done, if I let them dump me out of the service van & left overnight with no transportation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a Saturn because I could not afford a Toyota Corolla. However, my driving experience has been great. I drove this car from Alabama to Texas and back. It did not give me any problems. After I purchased my Saturn, one of my friends decided to purchase one. If you are in the market for an affordable and reliable car, I would strongly advise you to consider purchasing this vehicle. The monthly payments are extremely affordable too. If you are looking for luxury, honey you are looking in the wrong place. Remember that the car's main objective is to get you from point A to Point B. That's it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I typically buy foreign cars. In selecting Saturn, I reviewed the fuel efficient and its environmental impact. I wanted to buy an American car again, but I have had problems in the past. Anyway, I bought the ION brand new in 2007. I have been put in a rental car for a total of two weeks over the past year due to problems with my vehicle: I was driving on the highway and my vehicle started decelerating while I had my foot on the gas. It took them three go arounds to fix that. Right now, my passenger window will not roll up. My seatbelt light indicating that something is wrong with it goes on intermittently. Cheap interior. The mileage is good though all around - not impressed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My college daughter had driven this car in Grand Rapids for the past year with wonderful fuel economy and through a lot of hard winter days. This was a great buy and it is too bad GM stopped making this fuel efficient and affordable small vehicle. She loves the center display as she is short and can see the road better with nothing block her forward vision. With a manual transmission the highway economy is 35mpg. She claims this is a very quiet car and I would agree as I have a couple of Saturn Vues, 2006 and 2007 and it is by far more quiet then these more expensive Saturns on the highway. With full airbags I feel confident she is in a safe vehicle even thought it is a compact.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched compadible vechicles, and either the price for what I needed and the fit for size and comfort was not met by these other options. This vehicles runs great, handles nicely and even though it is not a stick, the 2.2l engine still gave me 34.6 miles per gallon for highway driving on its first road trip. This is impressive considering it is larger than the Saturn SL2 that I could squeeze as much as 40 miles to the gallon under certain conditions, but was to small for taller passangers. I will keep an eye on it to see what overall performance will be in the future, having owned a Saturn in the past, I believe it will be impressive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My fiance got the car in April of 07. Bought it off the showroom floor with 43 miles on it. Started off getting 24 mpg, and slowly dropped off to about 16-18 mpg. The car has 23k on it now, and we have replaced both headlight assembly's twice due to moisture. The rotors got warped for no apparent reason last month, with hardly any wear at all on the pads. Everything inside the car started vibrating at around 5k miles, and at the same time around 5k miles, the transmission was acting up. Theres a constant knocking noise coming from the fuel pump, like we have a person locked in the trunk. And the cheap hankook tires were dry rotted before 12k hit. To be a brand new car, it sure has had a lot of issues!</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a good thing that Saturn stopped making the ION. This car developed rattles after about 1000 miles, it's gas mileage has gone from about 35 average to about 13. It's going to go to the wrecker soon if it keeps losing it's solid "new car" feeling. It has some pep, but that just makes the fuel pump sound like someone knocking to get out of the trunk. This car is fun to drive, but knowing that each press of the gas pedal is costing a few dollars and listening to all the interior rattle and buzz makes me drive like a senior citizen. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an Ion3 Quad Coupe 2.4 based on the test drive. I was replacing a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3. I found the Ion3 has a softer ride & corners better. Much less lean. I have not had to return it to the dealer for other than routine required maintenance. I liked my Focus but I love my Ion3. Both equipted with auto trans. The Ion3 is just a more comfortable car to drive. I have not had it on any trips on the highway, just in city driving. I check my mileage on each tank & it is about 25-26 MPG. I have no clue what the highway milage is. I am just as pleased with the car today as the day I bought it. Dent resistent panels are a plus, too bad 07 is the last year for them.</TEXT>

I like the electronic steering. My ION is easier to handle than my SL 1 was . I was surprised by this car and it exceeds my expectations. The build quality is good and the interior is well put together .The Storm Grey color is beautiful. My ION holds the road well. Saturn refined the ION since its introduction and my 2007 shows the results.I do wish that the power window buttons would be easier to find at night.

<TEXT>Our daughter purchased the first model year (2003) ION, and is generally pleased with it. The ION has been refined and improved each year, then when they "perfected" it, they stopped making it. We purchased this car used (31,500 miles), but it looks, handles, and performs as if we just drove it out of the new car showroom. A good, solid feel to it, and fun to drive. A mistake with the original ION was the factory-installed Firestone tires (terrible), but they switched to Goodyear Assurance Comfortreds a few years ago, and they are great, safe tires! </TEXT>

The ION's handling is excellent. Headroom and legroom is impressive for this class of vehicle. Average fuel mileage (27 mpg) is not as good as our Corolla (30 mpg), but the ION feels much more spacious and comfortable inside. The ION's standard steering- wheel mounted cruise-control performs perfectly. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Headroom & legroom, quiet & smooth ride. Solid body assembly (no squeeks or rattles). Plenty of power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car for the mileage and am getting 32 mpg overall. Surprised on how much fun it is to drive. The 5spd shifts smooth, is peppy and car corners excellent. The large cargo area with independent folding rear and front seats and rear doors make this coupe a great value. Might want larger outside mirrors, better vision out rear side windows and a little more response in the steering. Otherwise its much better than adverised and must be a completely different car than the editors drove? Would recommend. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quad doors on the coupe, independent folding back seats. Great gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle is a very quick and fuel efficient for the amount of HP that it puts out. It does have limited rear leg room but its a coupe with power its made for the single people who drive around for fun, though children fit well in the back adults no. By me driving the speed limit and not gunning it which i did for the first week it on average will get 225 miles per 10 gallons of gas or 3/4 tank of fuel. If I drive it like normal I get about 210-215 per same amount of fuel, but it depends on the Driver my GF drove it for a week and got 230 from 10 gals. Wonderful car though!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The nice shape of the car, big trunk, and supercharger of course and depending on the features you get it has a good stereo and well lit gauges that are offset to the center of the dash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Saturn has come along way for sure. This is only one of their great line, but I chose the ION for the sport of driving. Manual shift for total control of this Ion-3 2.4 175HP. Totally functional, plenty of room, the doors for the rear are cool too. All in all, this car is fun. It moves when I ask it to, and I hate being on highways when I'm in overdrive, because there's no shifting necessary. At the same time, the cruise control works perfectly with the manual shift overdrive. Before I get home though, I take a few trips around the block to keep the shifting going. Of course, if you prefer less work, you get the same fun out of this car. This car ranks up there with my favorite cars</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dent proof panels, multiple safety features for protection and in accidents. OnStar a must, and comes with hands free cell speaker, so I do all my calls through the OnStar, voices come out of the speakers, while the microphone picks up mine clearly. Lay down rear seats extended cargo area.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owerall, it is a great car for the money, feels and rides like a larger car. I love the plastic door panels since I never get any dings. The only major drawback to this car is the awful dashboard design. There is no reason for the speedometer to be so far away in the middle of the dashboard where it is impossible to see. If it wasn't for this one bad design, it would be the perfect small car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Comparing this vehicle to my last car, 2001 Ford Focus ZX3. Ion ride is smoother than Focus. Corners better than Focus(less lean). Better acceration than Focus. Easier entry and exit than Focus ZX3. More interior room than Focus ZX3. Gas mileage is about the same, 24-25 mpg vs 24-25 mpg, even though the Ion has 175 HP vs Focus 130 HP. Ion steering has a better road feel. Ion trunk opens and closes easier than Focus. Ion rear seats fold down and back up easier than Focus. Entry to the rear of the Ion is easier with the Ion due to the rear quad coupe doors. Ion center console is almost useless. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I like the fact this car does not sell well because I would hate for some one to discover Saturn's best kept secret! I like being the only one around with this car. It is all mine. Not like a Mustang or Civic or SRT4 Neon. It's rare and it's fast, yet nimble. I have the carbon fiber dash kit wich adds some pizazz to the interior! I allso have GMPP stage 2. A non-voided performance upgrade from GM. The best thing is the supercharger whine! The noise the car makes under full load is amazing. I can't forget the dent resistant body panels. Going to the mall or just leaving the car in the yard I know its going to be dent free! Best car around for the price. Too bad it's in its last year of production.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Supercharger! Not the 1st thing people expect out of a Saturn with 12 LBS of boost and16 with stage 2. The recaro sport racing seats! They are so roomy and spacious! The short gear change and throw. Great daily driver. It has a big boot as well(trunk) Gotta love the limited slip and boost guage! I love it</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my ION when my 4-year-old VW Jetta needed a ridiculously expensive amount of repairs in order to pass the NJ emmissions exam. Since, I've never looked back. The car has no known issues that I've experienced and is very reliable, stable at high speeds and has actually been more fun to drive than the last car -- believe it or not. The dealership experience was great too. Pretty much everything you'd expect from Saturn's reputation. For those of us on a limited budget, the ION shows that we can still get a car that we actually enjoy driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent pick-up for a non-turbo 4-cylinder engine. Large trunk for a compact sedan. Good fuel economy for a long commute to work, and of course the factory radio sounds great too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took my ION 2 in for service 2 weeks after the initial 30 day exchange period. Major vibration, accompanied with various rattles from engine compartment. Remount power train. No change. Took it back a week later. Foam insulated my Washer Fluid tank, remount Engine. No change. 3 months later (trying to let prob get worse) foam reattach fan shroud (rattled lose) flash entire car computer. No change, gas mileage drops to 18mpg city. Foam insulate passenger headlight (now cockeyed) prior to getting home that day. Corporate insisted that 4 times isn't enough, take it to another shop. This shop now wants me to come get, and bring back next week for parts. 6 times in shop. 2600 miles. Avoid!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car! It is the first Saturn that I've ever owned and I love it! The mileage is great. I like the center dashboard and the responsiveness of the car. Currently, my car has a leaking problem, but the dealership gave me a loaner and I have confidence in them to fix it. Other than that, the car has been superb. I like the fact that if I need to accelerate quickly that it doesn't shift in to a "passing gear", but that it just accelerates! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This makes my 3rd Saturn and I love it. Smooth ride and low interior noise. Not a whole lot of shift shock from the auto transmission and it also has very good acceleration. The power steering is excellent, and it seems to really hug the corners. The suspension is very nice also, you don't even really notice going over RR tracks. Also very roomy for a smaller car. Excellent head room. The sunroof leaked early on, and Saturn gave me a loaner car and fixed it right away. So great service on their part. Also the low pressure approach of their sales team made the buying experience great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car after shopping the Honda Civic based on ride performance and equipment for the money. I figured the $3500 I saved would make up for a 3 mile per gallon difference. I drive 90 miles a day and am averaging 37 mpg with a high of 40.5mpg and a low of 34mpg. Mileage has increased at each fill. I now have 6000 miles on the car and have loved every mile. I love the room I have even though I am signficantly larger than average.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar phone that really reaches out and touches someone. Mileage outstanding. Sporty feel and comfortable, roomy ride. Fold down front passenger seat makes it a tremendous commuter vehicle. I carried home some 8 foot 2x4s without them sticking out anywhere!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had no problems owning this car. It has been a wonderful car since day one. I love the way it hugs corners, and the seats really support my body. I love the center dash because I don't really have to take my eyes off of the road to monitor my speed and other things, whereas you would to look between the steering wheel in a typical mounted dash. This economy sedan really puts the fun back into driving. The car is very responsive, but not too responsive like some cars. It seems to get pretty good gas mileage. This car performs very similar to a 6 cylinder car although it is a 4-cylinder. So I get good gas mileage in a car with plenty of power to get out of the way.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cargo space, center mounted dash, the dent resistent/rust resistent panels. The responsiveness. The styling, the seats being adjustable according to height of the driver and not just moving back or forward (the fact they actually move up and down), the roominess</FAVORITE>
