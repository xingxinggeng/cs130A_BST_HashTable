<TEXT>I purchased my Edge 1/09. I got it used with about 31k miles on it. The only problem with it was a noise coming from the gas tank. Once I let the dealership know, they took care of it free of charge to me. They said that it was the mechanism that keeps us from hearing the gasoline moving back and forth in the tank. Mine was loose and making lots of noise. No problems now!!! I travel to New York about twice a month and this is one sturdy and comfortable ride. The back seats recline some and the front seats are just wonderful. There is ample space in the back for luggage. Other than the gas tank issue, this has been a great experience thus far!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I received my Edge in May 2007. Vehicle was great until January 2008, when it started leaking transmission fluid. Brought to the dealership they told me nothing was leaking. I had to ride with windows down in January in Maine. They replaced seals in the differtial many times. The transmission has been replaced. Still leaking. Ford rep finally looked a the vehicle and they are replacing everything again. If this doesn't work they say they will buy the vehicle back. The vista roof also stuck open in a rain storm. Not fun!! The dealership had the vehicle for three weeks, during the repair they dented the roof, drivers door, and scrathed the doors on the inside. Dealership not helpful </TEXT>

<TEXT>The oil is constantly leaking have had the car in the shop multiple times, they can never find it or say that it doesn't need to be filled all the way for the transmission, then my panoramic sun roof exploded/shattered over my head one night driving down the road, nothing hit it and there were no other cars/trees, just shattered, scared me to death. Shock on right side leaking, smoking, fixed, not fixed, lost part, not the right part, what other excuse could Ford give. This is my first and last Ford, oh and the paint has bubbled on the drivers side door and the door lock on that side will never unlock with automatic unlock and they say it needs oil, ha that doesn't work either</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle shows the direction Ford is going. Better interiors, high quality and still amazing performance. This makes it a winner. I think any Dad would love this as a very safe, fun and versicle package. This car received the highest score for safety. Believe me once someone hits you and you are in a car accident you will check this every time before making a decision on a car for you and you family. Safest CUV available. I think any young or fun couple with love to have this in their garage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an SEL+ in Creme Brulee, loaded with all the options including the panorama roof and navigation system. I traded in a 2004 Explorer Eddie Bauer V8 for the Edge. Compared to the Explorer I like the ride, lower step in height, better mileage, and roomy back seat. On the downside the interior of the Edge is a sea of hard plastic and poorly styled interior elements; compare the front interior door panel of the Edge to a Saturn Outlook and you will see what I mean. The interior is way to cheap and cold feeling for a $35,000 car. The navigation system is good, but not great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My Edge is currently being serviced for it's fourth transmission seal and second PTU Assembly. Soon after purchase the interior began to rattle and reveal the cheap material and poor workmanship. The brakes perform poorly and the car continues to pull to the left for no reason. The dealer and Ford offer no support except to tell me the transmission problems are a known Edge defect. AWD is great in the winter, it's quiet, and the engine is powerful. Average 18 mpg. When not in the garage it's a fun car to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a difference from my orginal 06 Ford Escape Hybrid to a 07 Ford Edge, Ride is excellent and power is great, could have tuned engine better for better gas mileage, but I will give up the 3 or 4 miles over my Escape, Hybrid. With the Edge I will have the A/C always on, with the Hybrid you loose the A/C on Hybrid mode, Beware. Towing was real easy and with the all wheel drive a breeze with getting the boat out of the water. Styling has got allot of eyes looking at it and saying what is that and when I say a Ford, they say no way with that style. I would suggest test driving and seeing for yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our Edge for about a month now and are very pleased with the purchase. A couple of recommendations to Ford though: 1) the rear hatch needs to be power operated, 2) improve the vents on the driver's side, air seems to hit the steering wheel and doesn't cool the drive well. Initial quality has been outstanding. Built solid and has low road noise. Doesn't sit too high for my 5'2" wife to get in and out of, but is good hight for visibility. Gas mileage is fair, but we knew it wouldn't be great with the powerful 3.5L V-6.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle in June with high hopes, I'm over 6ft. After living with the vehicle I am sadly disappointed in its comfort. If your over I say 5'10 you need not apply. The seat bottom cushions are far to short to offer support for longer legs. The footwell for the driver is short on space also, making driving very uncomfortable and your only relief is when you go to cruise control on a hwy. Despite the suspect claims of good gas mileage from other reviewers the gas mileage stinks, only 18 for a 6cyl. is absurd. An Expedition gets as good. I was only getting 10 at first. I'm light footed on the gas so I dont hotdog. Im looking for a new vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 for the Ford Edge. Love the looks and style and do not miss my truck like I thought I would. Has a large cargo area and very fun to drive. Not to mention the better gas mileage. I was getting an average of 15 mpg with my dodge ram and according to the digital read-out on my new edge it says avg. 33 mp! So I am assuming I am getting an average of 33 mpg with it, but then again I have only put 233 miles on it. Handles great in the mountains, going up the hills. Very roomy interior and love all the cup holders. The lever to tilt the steering wheel is a little tough to operate, keep hitting my hairclip on the headrest and the speedometer gauge is hard to see.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All in all I think that Ford did a great job with the Edge. With modern styling and a practical design, this car really is the perfect mix between a car and an SUV. I had a 2003 Ford Explorer and it drives just like it. The best part is that I didn't have to give up a lot of space. It's a great family car and the safety features that come standard are above and beyond what you'll find in most vehicles in it's class. I am really pleased with my purchase and am so glad that Ford came out with a youthful version of a practical family sadan/sport utility vehicle mix. I can tote my kids around and not be embarrassed to drive it when going out with my friends. It's the best of both worlds! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the SEL Plus and traded my 2003 Expedition. We found that the space inside the Edge is a lot more than you think. We travel regularly with 4 pets and it works great for us. The styling is nice, hard to believe it's a Ford! With all the incentives, 0% financing, you have to consider this over the Acura MDX for 47k. You'll save a ton of money and be happy with your new car too! The moonroof is amazing, good powerful engine, nice sight out the large front window and a huge amount of back seat room for adults to sit. We just drove it 600 miles and got about 21 mpg with it loaded down, including stops and traffic. To me that's all you can ask for.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large moonroof and smooth ride, great gas mileage too. It even has an iPod function to plug one in and play it over the stereo.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Edge in Feb. 2007. Bought it without a second thought or test drive. One look and I was sold. Love, love, love the Edge. I get many compliments on it and its a real head turner driving down the road. Ford you really did it for me this time. Have almost 6,000 miles and no complaints and don't anticipate any either. I have been a Ford buyer for more than 25 years and have yet to be disappointed in anything I have gotten from Ford. I am an American and drive an American icon and couldn't be more proud. Quality is superb, I have never questioned the quality of American cars. Ford will always be #1 for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a family vehicle but don't want a minivan or full size SUV, Edge is it. I've read all the reviews from major publications to googling Ford Edge reviews. Only real knock I can find are the brakes, its 60-0 stop is lackluster, Ford, please address. All around, engine is stellar, 6-speed auto performs well, handling nice feel but not ultra sporty, ride quality the same, blend of comfort not to squishy (Buick Like) but not Mazda like either. Test drove all others, came down to CX-7 and Edge. Wanted the CX-7 to be the winner but Edge had more room, easier access to rear seats, ie, car seats, just more practical day to day. Crash test ratings can?t be beat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look, interior space, opening size for rear doors and rear hatch, 6-speed tranny (responsive downshift), Safety features (ratings). Reliable; know a regional service manager for large rental company, Edge blows away its domestic brethren, far fewer trips to the shop, noted impressive build quality</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I only have a few miles on the Edge, but it's easy to see it's a winner. I came back to Ford after a Chrysler van, and am happy I did. The van was a nice car, but the Edge is easier to drive, easier to enter and exit, easier to park, and has much better handling. It also has much better seats and better ergonomics everywhere. The styling is uncluttered; the car looks ultra modern both in an out. The expansive sunroof is a great feature. Multiple airbags everywhere make safety a strong suit as well. It's not perfect, but it's way up there in its class. I did a detailed comparison, and the Edge won over the SanteFe, the VeraCruz, the Murano, the Pacifica, the Highlander, and the Pilot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, styling, ergonomics, creme brulet color, handling, interior and exterior lighting features, smooth transmission, quiet engine and cabin, space inside, (especially considering overall size), safety features. The SEL+ is the way to go in this vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>Vista Roof (BAMR)and great rear seat room. I read the reviewers complaints about no third row seat. If it had one we would not of bought it. It is a sporty people mover with style. The handling is superb and very confident. I like the balance between ride and handling - Ford nailed this one!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Spent 3 months looking for CUV. Tried the Edge, CRV, RAV4, Pilot, Outlander, VUE, CX-7, & CX-9. Came down to the CX- 7 & the Edge. After driving them back to back, the Edge came out on top. Not as "sporty", but V-6 feels stronger than the Turbo 4 & burns regular. Vista Roof is incredible. It's like having a convertible CUV. Nav & Sound system are great, along with SIRIUS. Got Black/Black with the 18" chrome wheels...fantastic looking vehicle just adds to great driving experience. Contrary to a magazine review I read, brakes work very well. I may even buy a few shares of Ford stock - the Edge is that good. Great follow-up to the Fusion/Milan/MKZ. Proves they can build best-in-class autos.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NAV, Audio, & Sirius. Seat position is perfect; good lumbar & nice to have telescoping wheel, too. Flex seating opens up a lot of cargo space very easily. Exterior design is striking - neighbors thought it was luxury import. V-6 & 6-sp tranny are smooth, powerful, and take regular. Many others.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this vehicle for two weeks and, so far, I love it. I had a Volvo XC70 and I prefer the Edge over the Volvo. The overall feel of quality is remarkable. This vehicle is smoother, quieter, and faster than the Volvo and has more room inside. The motor revs freely and pulls hard from a stop, with the help of the close ratio 6-speed automatic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my EDGE about 10 days. When applying the brakes, it sounds like metal-on-metal, just like I have gone too long without changing pads, and am now riding on bare metal shoes. The dashboard lights are very dim, no matter how far I turn the dial up. I'm a big guy and that isn't the Edge's fault , but short trips are better on my left knee that is jammed against the side door. Right knee is okay. I drive alone, so there are no passenger complaints. Gas mileage averages about 27MPG so far which is better than I thought. Will have to readjust headlight beam throw as the length of lighting comes up short, high beams superb!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a gas guzzling F-150 for the new Edge and couldn't be happier. I'm getting about 50% better gas mileage in town (13 vs. 19mpg) which should improve as the engine gets worn in a little more. I also own a Chrysler Pacifica (which we love) but this vehicle is more fun to drive and has better acceleration. I have just over 1000 miles on it now and can't find anything I don't like about it. I find myself having to gingerly press the gas pedal or I will be going 70 in the city before I know it. Got it with the Nav system and can now say it was worth the extra cost, especially since it becomes a central control center for the other audio/video systems</TEXT>

Then add 2.5 mpg improvement and the fact we don't need to put in Premium, I figure we'll save two lease payments a year in gas. The Egde has gotten noticed too. Our neighbors who currently have an '05 Murano are now looking at going to the Edge once their lease is up.</TEXT>

While the Ford Edge did not have the best reviews, I loved the test drive of the vehicle. It had a look and feel that was awesome. It is bigger than I wanted. My husband "allowed" me free will in my car buying this go around. He felt I made a good choice, so kudos for me. It is very roomy, my husband is 6'3 and he has no issues with is fit. With two boys, we will need the room. The nostalgia of the Ford name also made a difference for me also. I am enjoying the vehicle and attention the it is getting me. Everyone asks me what is it!

<TEXT>This vehicle is one of the nicest 'Utility' vehicles that I've ever driven. It has a quiet and comfortable interior, and the suite of luxo-goodies doesn't hurt. The engine delivers power smoothly when requested. Handling is good and adds to the fun-factor, but the Edge is no sports car. It is heavy and, although the Edge maintains control, you feel that weight when you push the limits. Overall, a pleasure to drive. I appreciate its just-right size when compared to the larger boats like the GMC Acadia. With 800+ miles on mine, Mileage is OK at 19 MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Edge is awesome looking on the outside but is very lacking on the interior. The interior materials are cheesy plastic and really need to be upgraded. This is a heavy truck and needs a more powerful engine. Around town it is great but highway aceleration is poor. The sound system stinks and needs an upgrade. I already miss the monsoon system I had in my VW. Ford needs to think about adding the little touches that will make this ride a true standout, automatic open and close lift gate, keyless entry and start, sensors on the front which alert you to cars in front of you. Pretty much take all of the features found in the VW Toureg and put them in the Edge. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am so happy with it. The Edge is just so much fun to drive. I'm not real sure about the gas mileage because I'm still on my first tank of gas but I was previously driving a Windstar so I can only believe it will be about the same or better! I love the power that the Edge has. The body style is absolutely gorgeous! My Edge is the Creme Brulee color - it looks very classy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We drove the Murano before deciding on the Egde. Murano CVT simply could not decide what to do with itself - very annoying. The Edge does everything very well and it is screwed together like nothing else we drove. Good vision, comfortable for driver and passengers, fully featured and it gets a lot of admiring looks. Maybe there is hope for the American car industry after all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Headed down to my Ford garage to buy my third Explorer, but really didn't want to face another 5 years of sub 20 MPG at $4.00 per gallon. Dealer suggested trying the new Edge. After trial, bought one. I have owned it for about one month and I like it. It is the only vehicle I have ever owned that people on the street turn and look at. My neighbors all came over to see the car that can drive on the edge of buildings. Haven't tried that yet. The suspension is much softer than the Explorer and other truck-based vehicles. This will take a while to get used to. I am hoping for average mileage North of 20 MPG. Too soon to tell.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is surprising, but it has more interior cargo room than the Explorer. The SEL plus allows the front passenger seat to fold flat as well. </FAVORITE>

Great looks, people stop me in parking lots to ask about it and look inside. They say it looks like a Lexus. All in all it is just what we need and want in a CUV. Also it's very fun to drive!

<TEXT>Bought in Feb '07 and have found it to be a great vehicle, fun to drive, and very roomy. Ford all around did a nice job for a 1st year vehicle and entrance into a new market. Looked at Toyota Highlander and Saturn Outlook. Even looked at a couple of vans and went with the Edge. Mileage is OK. I'm now getting 17.3 around town but you have to let the mileage calculation span over a couple of tanks of gas to get a more accurate reading. I would definetely recommend seriously considering it if you're in the market for new vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't believe me do you? Most people don't know that Ford owns Range Rover. Many times I rode in my friend'd $80k Rover and salivated. Then I drove the Edge and oh my gosh! I felt right back in the Rover. Same wheel, stereo, ride, feel, stiffness, and power. It's even faster than a BMW X5. It is also the first Ford to appear prestigious in all manner of profiles. Nav and XM are also perfect, just lacked Bluetooth. Oh, and the entire back seat reclines so far back that Hulk Hogan could side cross his legs. Folding front seat into a table-esque platform makes it a limo, and the center console can conceal an entire laptop. Perfect, just perfect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at the Honda CRV, the Mazda CX-7, the Pontac Torrent, and the Mercury Mariner, I decided to go drive an Edge. That was all it took. The Mazda had a bit more zip, due to its turbocharger, but really lacked for room inside, and towing capacity was not there. The Edge is much roomier than the Mazda, not as roomy as the CRV. The CRV was a really nice ride, but only had 166HP, and didn't have the zip I wanted, even on the interstate. This vehicle is by far the most fun to drive of any I've ever owned. The only thing I do not like is the headrest is at an angle which is somewhat uncomfortable on long rides, and I think they are a smidge overpriced.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had been looking at CUV's for some time and then I test drove this car. My drive was mostly on the freeway and I was shocked at the outstanding ride. Bought one on the spot! Have since gone on two short trips and could not be happier! Beautiful exterior topped only by the interior. Vista roof is amazing. Love the 18" chrome wheels. Mileage could be better but this car is by far the best in this class. You owe it to yourself to test drive the Edge and make sure you take it on the freeway as it just glides down the road!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took an Acadia home overnight and after nearly 150 miles I could tell it was nowhere near the advertised mileage. I drove a similarly equipped Edge and thought for approximately $2K less it was the better of the two vehicles. The transmission is smoother and even though it doesn't shift up and down with the buttons the engine braking feature on O/D lockout is much better than on older Ford vehicles. The vehicle is fun to drive, and has a much more comfortable driving postion over my Honda Pilot, thanks to a more comfortable seat and the telescoping wheel. I was getting over 26 MPG on a trip on the interstate and am getting around 21-22 on the mountainous roads I drive daily to work</TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay, it might be a bit early to jump to such wild assumptions, but I love this vehicle. Not seeing a lot of them yet out here, so I get the "What kind of car is that" question followed by, "no way that is a Ford". So the ego of course is inflated, but driving this thing is where you will fall in love. On ramps with all four wheels pulling are instant smile makers. Stomp the accelerator at 65 and feel yourself pulled back in the seat when the auto tranny smoothly downshifts to 3rd and 5500 rpms and you rocket past that pain hovering at 65 in the left lane. I thought my 525 would always be my favorite driver, but the Edge has made that a distant memory.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I, as many others, was very skeptical about Ford's first real crossover. (Freestyle doesn't really count). I test drove it as well as the GMC Acadia. What it came down to for me was the lease deal. Ford is pushing the Edge pretty hard and the lease interest rate I got was .75%. That pretty much sealed the deal for me. But once I started driving it I was totally blown away. First off, the drive is super smooth and quiet. It's quick and relatively agile. Bottom line... FUN! The interior has some minor lower quality plastics, but the overall quality is very good. The leather seats are very high quality and look and feel terrific. Overall this CUV seems to be a home run!</TEXT>

Outside the CSUV is a head turner and the inside has a great balance of usable features, comfort, style and a massive Vista roof. We drove the Nissan and Mazda and they couldn?t compare to the great ride afforded by the Edge. The Edge also beats the others with better all around quality on the exterior and interior. The powerfully matched engine and transmission really sets it apart from the Nissan and the Mazda. Great looks, great performance and a good price. What a fun vehicle to drive.

At first I was hesitant, but as soon as I test drove one, I was very surprised at the fun-to-drive capability and the style. I didn't know Ford has this kind of a car before. I like the huge sunroof (Vistaroof?) and the ample center console. The 2nd row seats are folded just by a touch of a button, which is awesome.

<AUTHOR>Edge wins by an Edge</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I looked at cars for > 1 year and I'm glad I waited. Looked at the Edge, Mazda CX-7 & CX-9, and Nissan Murano (and many many more). Nissan and Mazda wouldn't negotiate price. Ford did (two $500 rebates, 3.9% financing, and near invoice price) and that sealed the deal - In my case. Safety features are excellent, ride comfortable, well planted and quiet, with plenty of power. For example, drove at high speed and pushed the pedal, and quickly went higher with easily more to spare. Transmission shifts silky smooth. I never owned a Ford before but am glad I considered them. I recommend that you do the same if you are considering a crossover. I rented an Edge for 3 days before buying.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, room & comfort, & safety. Panoramic vista roof. I read the reviews and drove all the cars that I considered.

<TEXT>What a vehicle! Spacious, comfortable, sharp looking, quiet ride, and from early experience it appears to be built well with solid craftsmanship. The Edge is well designed in the cab allowing easy access to the controls and giving each of the passengers ample room and drink storage. The exterior design is certainly a head turner -- especially when you equip the vehicle with the 18" wheels (which come standard on this trim line). My Edge is black with the camel leather interior -- it looks great. So far, the performance of the engine and transmission has been flawless. The 6 speed automatic shifts smoothly and allows me to cruise at high speeds at only 1500- 1700 rpms.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been driving a midsize SUV and been waiting for this kind of fuel efficient crossover long time. Test-drove Murano, but heck, it's too overpriced. Finally I test drove an Edge and just I was sold to it. The fuel economy is much better than I expected and the vista roof gives me a huge view to the sky, which is terrific. So nice looking outside and very BIG inside. The inside space is one of my favorites. The gauges and controls are convenient and friendly. V6 and auto go very well together. I love to drive my Edge everyday. It's fun to drive. The trunk space is also very generous and 2nd row seat is big enough for my 6' 5" son. 18" tire is a good idea, too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The braking distance, which has been much discussed, has not been an issue other than that it is longer than my '05 Acura TL or my wife's previous car, a '00 Focus. Exterior design and interior design are spot on, with a surprising amount of legroom in the second row, even for passengers 6'3". As the car is now only 3 weeks old, we have had no reliability issues. The new 3.5L V6 is a little noisy on heavy acceleration from a stop, but very quiet at speed. The vehicle feels planted in the cloverleafs, with minimal body lean and no tire squeal. We cross-shopped this vehicle with the BMW X3, Mazda CX-7, Cadillac SRX, Mitsubishi Outlander, and Toyota Highlander. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As a life-long Dodge guy, I was apprehensive about my wife's suggestion to check out the new Ford Edge, but I'm glad I did. After months of looking at others, we settled on a fully loaded Edge SEL+. The most striking feature is how it doesn't look like everything else out there. The interior fit and feel was great, and gauges and dials were nicely laid out. The only downside was that it was difficult to locate the exact vehicle we wanted. We were told by the dealership that the hold up was factory caused due to issues with the Vista roof. The Vista roof is highly innovative and well worth the extra money. V-6 engine feels well mated with the smooth 6 speed tranny. Nice vehicle! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior styling....BAM! Pictures do not do it justice. In person, it is big and bold and grabs your attention.

I was a little concerned that Ford couldn't seem to get them out of the plant, but I will assume caution was the order of the day and will say I am glad I waited. The interior is church quiet and the ride incredibly smooth. Thanks to the new 6 speed transmission you are at 1900 rpms at 70 mph. Just cruising. The new 3.5 liter engine is very smooth and provides plenty of punch. The leather front seats are nicely styled with contrast stitching and hold you firmly. The ride is excellent. As good as or better than a top notch sedan. The exterior styling is strong and fresh. Ford got this one right. No joke.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pretty decent sound on the stereo with an input jack for an iPod in the center console. It comes with Sirius for 6 months, then you pay up or drop it.

In Jan 09 started leaking worse than before, had to drive with the window down the smell was so bad. Finally got it back yesterday after 17 days. Replaced PTU and axle shaft. To make matter worse the gas mileage is "awful. When I first got it best I got was 14mpg - since it got cold try 8-9mpg. Dealer told me there is bad gas around here. Give me a break!

We got the black paint w/the black leather interior, sweet. Its gorgeous. Love the navagation system, sr, cd player and tons of pre-sets for everything. Heated seats, dual climate controls. Smooth ride. The car handles pretty well, not as tough as I thought in the snow but I didn't get the AWD. There is a button to press for slippery cond's, that does help. Super quiet inside. Great package inside and out. 20,000 miles, cert. pre-owned with 100,000 m warranty. 120 miles on 1/2 a tank, no complaints on gas mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Vehicle is a lemon. Avoid purchasing. Returned 5 times for ptu unit leak. Oil leak so bad caused engine fire. Back from garage less than a week and leaking again. Transmission needs replacement, shudders and rolls backwards on hills. Rear hatch panels seperated from vehicle- twice before being replaced. Gas miliage not even close to advertised.

<TEXT>I have had the Ford Edge for two months and it only has 22000 km. It has been in the shop numerous times. The drive shaft, a wheel bearing and parts of the Vista roof have all been replaced. I took it in again because there was an odd woooooo noise at exactly 90 km and 40km. Was told it's "tire noise" ( Continental Cross Contacts) I was driving yesterday and the vehicle just lost power in the middle of traffic. The ABS , powertrain and anti slip lights all came on. A faulty sensor? I now wait for some part to come up from the US. Numerous unexplained noises, poor braking, Ice builds up on the inside of the vista roof. It's terrible in the snow.

<TEXT>If you are looking for a headache of an SUV, do purchase the Ford Edge. I have actually sued Ford and won under the lemon law statutes from this vehicle continually being in the shop multiple occurances. (as of writing this, my Edge has been in the shop a total of 38 days) Six times to get the power door locks to work. I just got the vehicle back out of the shop for a leaking transmission seal for the fifth occurence. They have replaced the transaxle, ptu shaft, changed the seal 5 times. It has lots of rattles. The vista sunroof assembly had to be completely removed and replaced. I should have known better when drving the vehicle home, and the trim falls off on the sunroof.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The steering, acceleration and braking are quite smooth. But on (rare) occasions when I truly stomp on the gas, there is a loud clunk/jolt from under the hood. Comfortable leather seats. Poor center console - you have to remove the top tray to get to anything toward the bottom. The visibility out the back window is poor between the tint and the elevated head rests. We have the reverse sensor and that has been quite helpful. I am averaging 17.3 mpg which is pretty disappointing. The AC is weak for truly hot days. I have to keep the AC on the coldest setting, with the fan maxed out to keep from sweating. Great legroom. Suspension / road noise are both OK but not great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased my Edge in February of 2008. One week later someone plowed into the passenger side causing $9500+ in damages. Walked away with no injuries whatsoever. I didn't really feel much at inside the vehicle at all. No signifant body roll considering. Extremely safe. No real complaints except the dealer flashed the computer and I lost some power. Engine noise is a tad loud, but it's am American vehicle - it happens. Traded a loaded 05 Altima (3.5 V6) for my Edge and glad I did. Gets better fuel mileage, believe it or not. Drove from MA to SC fully loaded w/4 adults, a child and a full load of luggage. Gassed up at the first BP we could find and averaged 30- 33 mpg at 70-75 mph. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted an AWD/4WD vehicle, but was tired of driving a truck. I love the vista roof--the safer alternative to a convertible. I love the acceleration and the ride. The exterior gives it kind of a "mean" appearance and demands a second look from everyone I pass. In different light the Pewter color sometimes looks Silver, baby blue or a pretty pale green. The 18 inch chrome wheels, Pewter paint, and black leather interior have people staring at this car everywhere I go and I've heard nothing but compliments. A recent 2000 mile road trip produced 30mpg at 45, 27 at 55, and 24-25 at 65-70mph. Not bad considering some of this was through the PA mountains. No recalls, rattles or problems.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling--both inside and out. Legroom- -very roomy...back seat legroom is almost limo-like. Powerports everywhere. Power-heated seats with memory buttons, heated mirrors, mpg hwy, comfortable seats, dual climate control, automatic rear-view mirror, reverse sensor..many more</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had the vehicle just over a year. Like the space, styling, ride, color (redfire),and handling. Feels great to drive. But a lot of cheap plastic. Unprotected metal seat glides have sharp edges. Seatbelt detectors balatantly visible. From day 1 it has drifted/pulled to the left. Taken in numerous times, told that's just the way it is. Helicopter effect takes some getting used to even with front windows open. Deep console is OK but you need to take everything out to get to the lower layer. Cloth seats seem "utilitarian", like my old cheap truck. Hate dark interiors so I like the stone color. Lincoln's very is overkill. Wonder what a Mercury version would have been like.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride height, visibility, and looks. At a time when so many vehicles look alike, at least you know what it is coming and going. (Although new 3bar grille on its Fusion and Taurus' do look alike. Great leg room front and back. (Who needs a 3rd row of seats?)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought our Edge as a true crossover, replacing a '01 Mustang GT and a '00 Xterra. The Edge has lived up to almost all of our expectations (Roominess of Xterra, comfort & power of the 'Stang). Great fuel mileage given the size and power of the car. The seats are wonderfully comfortable and supportive. I would challenge anyone to find another car/crossover/mid-size SUV with better second-row legroom. Value received for priced paid is incredible (again, compare to other crossovers/mid-size SUVs).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audiophile sound system sounds fantastic! Sporty, aggressive appearance (and power to match). Second-row legroom, cargo capacity, comfort, and fit-and-finish inside and out. Very quiet (Ford says quieter than a Lexus RX330, believe it!) </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Went from midsize car (Chrysler) to the Edge. First impressed with build quality and design. Over time, still not comfortable with the ride height, Ford Flex looks better. Seats are not as comfortable as when first driven. The driver seat adjustment controls leave a lot be desired. The blind spot due to A-Pillar and mirror combination are daunting. Backup warning system is a must when trying to navigate through small dark,rear window. Overall height makes loading the cargo area harder since items need to be lifter higher. Engine is strong, maybe too strong as experienced at full throttle, torque steer is hard to fight. Gas mileage range is 20 city & 26 highway, very good for the size.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There's a mystery clunk in the front end that occurs on almost all Edges the dealer tests - no fix for it yet. Vehicle rattles much more than I expected - on cracked and seamy pavement, over RR tracks - mostly the doors moving around. World's most illegible instruments. Ford should have used the Fusion's instrument faces. Love the power train; it's more manipulable than you'd think. Love the seats. Love the quiet; 1400 rpm at 62 mph! Over 13 years I've found my small-town Ford dealer to be excellent; so good I drive there (about 30 miles) for oil changes! Mine is front-wheel drive. With the right snow tires (Yokohamas)it's more than adequate, saves close to $2000 and improves mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After almost a year with the Edge we went back to a loaded 2007 Town & Country. Gas mileage is the same and the TC is 2X the size inside. The Edge is a great looking SUV but the interior build materials are simply horrible, 1 large flat hard plastic piece after another. And Ford was so cheap they painted many of the plastic interior pieces. Any time you say touch the glove box with a kids school bag or a shoe it puts a nice scratch on it. Our 18" rims were allready replaced after only 1 winter, they were all pitted out. Gas mileage is OK at 18-19 in town and 22-24 HWY, but the huge TC van gets the same. We simply couldn't live with the cheap KIA interior.</TEXT>

Locked the car at the post office and could not get the driver's door to unlock - had to go to passenger side and reach across to unlock from inside. Materials in cabin have a really cheap feel.

<TEXT>Bought the Edge last March and have been very happy, with just a couple of exceptions. The gas mileage is horrible. Granted, I live in Tampa and drive in the worst possible traffic, but Ford promised 18-22 MPG and I'm lucky to get 14, and truly blessed to get 15. During the buying process, I turned my nose up at crossovers that avertised less than 18, and here I am getting 14 anyway. Also, I now have to replace my 2nd blinker bulb after 1.5 years. I've never had to change a blinker bulb in my life before, and now this is twice in one year on the same car. Worries me a little on the rest of the quality. Time will tell. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Did lots of research and thought Ford was really becoming competitive with foreign auto brands...WRONG!!! From day one, something was not right with my Edge. The headlights were cracked from the inside upon purchase. At 5000 miles, the transmission felt off - searching for gears, excessive shifting. When the OD, it struggled and revved too high. At 8000 miles the tranny blew while I was driving on a mountain pass - I lost total control of the vehicle and was forced to use the E break to pull off the road. The tranny was replaced, but at 16000 miles it was dripping oil from the tranny again - this time an axle rod. I told Ford I didn't feel safe & was treated like an annoyance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This CUV is excellent looking, and very nice, we got the car and loved it, we had an Expedition before so we decide to go for better gas mileage. Well, its been a year since we bought it and I'm not impressed with it. I'm very forgiving when it comes to rating cars, the little blemishes found on the brand new car shouldn't been there. For an example, the door handles had a little mat in the cavity to cover up the bolt showing was gone the first time we vacummed the car, cheap and not the best way to design the car. The plastic covers in the back gate (lift gate) comes off when I close the gate. No foot rest for the driver.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the Edge, no going back to my unreliable and mostly unresponsive, GM vehicles. The Ford is great, seems very safe and reliable. Our main issues are the A/C (always on max, not enough air flow from vents to keep you cool in Arizona) and gas mileage (17- 19). The vehicle had 21,000 miles on it when we bought it, should be better. Also, there is a peculiar smell occasionally, smells like natural gas and we see some light wisps of smoke out from the hood area. Dealer says nothing wrong with it. For the price, though, it's a great vehicle and we'd never be able to buy a Murano here for the same price range!</TEXT>

It handles very well with quick cornering response. The 263hp V-6 is a hot engine. I hear Ford is already thinking of dumping it. Don't do it! I love the Vista Roof.

Lots of room in the back for more than just children to ride comfortably! The interior is average, but its very functional and very comfortable. Along with most cars, there are a few things I would like to see changed for the models to come. The way the armrest is set up in the back makes it hard to see out the rear view mirror. The brakes are sketchy for me, the have grooves in them and the dealer said it was normal on the Edge...hmm. Other than that, very sport and get lots of compliments! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ford Edge is a great value for a roomy 5 passanger crossover suv. I have a large carseat in the center backseat, and I can still fit two adults pretty comfortably back there. Good Leg/head room. It is a fun car to drive. It has smooth strong exelleration. Easy to park. Even in tight mall parking lots, its very nible. MPG's are pretty good on the highway, when I'm on cruse I get about 25mpg. The crossovers I was considering were: Acadia, Murano, and FX35. I think the Edge is the best looking externally.

The Sirius radio is wonderful as is the rest of the sound package. The speakers are average. The tire system detects low pressure in your tires. This is a good feature, however, it is too sensitive.

<TEXT>I recommend the Ford Edge, it is fun to drive, handles excellent with good acceleration. When I first got it I had to train myself to stop driving so fast. It is also the perfect height, low enough to handle well but high enough to feel like you are sitting in a chair instead of with your legs out in front of you like you are on the floor. Before this I had a 6 cyl Subaru Outback 04, before that a V-6 Lexus ES300 98. Both of these handled very well but did a number on my back and I couldn't see anything sitting so low to the ground. I'm getting around 20 mpg which I feel is good for a 3.5L 265hp. Rides smooth too!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have 26,000 miles on vehicle. No problems whatsoever. Only work done was routine oil changes - so far very reliable. In 2007, Ford did not offer the sync option for audio/mp3 players (which is now offered on 2008 cars). I would have preferred that over the wire connections that I must make now. Overall experience is that I am very happy with this car and would buy it again. Combined hwy/city mileage is a solid 18mpg - don't expect more from AWD equipped car. Although the Edge has been out a year now, I still get a lot of questions from people about the car. The styling appears to be popular.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy (We have four person family), versatility, styling, safety, power, & vista roof. I also like the tire pressure monitor, it came in handy twice when I was getting flats (nails) and allowed me to get repairs without getting stranded. Headlights are excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really like the Edge. My wife has a Ford Expedition, but this is my first Ford. I've had many imports: Honda, Audi, Infiniti, Nissan, VW, Toyota, and so far this one is right up there with the best brands. Nice combo with powerful engine and smooth trans. Excellent safety features. Drives very nice on highway. Some blind spots (backup sensors option is must have). The only thing I do not like is the middle backseat is very tight, can not fit three adults in backseat (only fits two adults and a small child in middle). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ext. styling, versatility of CUV, engine, transmission, sat. radio, seating position, overall fit and finish is good. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great curb appeal and comfortable. That's about it. City driving gas mileage averages around 15mpg - not much better than my 2004 Explorer. Difficult to see outside or rear window - back headrests block view. However, most troubling is the constant whining which dealership attributes to the fuel pump. Sorry. they say, there is nothing we can do. Because its a new model, Ford has little documentation on this problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We own or have owned 2 competing vehicles this year. Picked the Edge based on payment & 98% on looks. My 07' Hyundai Santa Fe & 08' Hyundai Veracruz are leagues above the Edge in build quality, refinement & pamper level. Edge is quite quick, handles nice. Lots of looks, comments from other drivers. But if one doesn't care so much about looks, the Santa Fe or Veracruz are simply night & day in quietness, refinement, smoothness & quality. A difference likened between Toyota Rav4 VS BMW X5 V8. The Edge is nice to drive & acceptable. The Hyundai's are simply impressive every time you drive them. I'd have to say they are 3 - 5 tiers above the Edge. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had this vehicle for around three weeks now. We brought a 2007 for the incentives and had an "A" plan, that made the price hard to beat. Problem is, we are averaging 14.1 mpg. My wife drives the car to work M-F 15 miles highway driving. We have asked other Edge owners what their average MPG is and the normal response is "20 - 25." Also, window wipers freeze up and make the blades useless. Where they are located is a collection area for rain and snow. Not very well thought out. Would strongly advise looking at other crossover's as this one cost more in gas than a Suburban would!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice ride, smooth and secure on snowy/icy roads (which is common here in the U). Poor gas mileage and wiper system make this vehicle ruin this vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We got our Edge 3 weeks ago and love it. It is so much fun to drive. We got a 2007 floor model:, Black w/ tan leather, heated seats, Sirius, 18" Alloy tires, rear-sensor, fog lights, roof rack, power everything. The Vista Roof was not on the floor model. The car drags slightly to the right and I found out this was an issue for some of the '07 Edge and Lincoln MXK's (see TBS's on fordedgeforum dot com). I brought it in to the dealer, with the TSB # and they ordered the part. It was not installed yet. Other than that, it is an awesome car. Drives like a solid car with the room of an SUV. So comfortable. Looks better than any SUV out there, stylish, yet simple. Gas mileage is OK.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, I'll never be able to go back. Very roomy and comfortable, best leather seats we sat in for cars in this class. Rear-sensor as there is a bit blind spot in about all CUVs nowadays. Plenty of storage in center console. Rear seats fold down from the back via button, very convenient.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just purchased our Edge, SE basic edition, about 2 weeks ago. What a fun machine to drive! We found it to be quite nimble in turns, light and quick on the accelerator, and an interior so quiet, my husband turned off the engine and restarted it because he couldn't hear it! Solid, roomy, comfortable, I like it every bit as much as I did my Expedition, but easier to smile at the gas station now! Still has the creature comforts we like, power door locks, windows, DVD, at a nice, no-frill price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Edge has the vista roof. Unfortunatly, the headliner was not attached properly and it was haning down and it rattled like crazy. It took four trips to the dealer, but they were really good and finally got the parts. Rattle and sagging are completly fixed. Now, I can drive this car without being constantly annoyed. I get great gas mileage (24 mpg hwy) and the car is very easy to drive and fairly responsive for a SUV. I like the reverse stiching in the seats.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had the vehicle for four months and have been very impressed. We traded a 2002 Ford Explorer and have had no regrets. I am 6'2" and am very pleased with the leg room, both front and back. Leg room and shoulder room is better than our old Explorer. It drives very smoothly and acceleration is more than adequate. The panoramic vista moonroof is wonderful and the reclining rear seats are very inviting. Road handling is is authoritative and minor bumps go relatively unfelt. The only thing we lost was rear cargo space, as our Explorer had significantly more room in the rear cargo area. However, this was not one of our criteria. We wholeheartedly recommend the Ford Edge.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Edge is my first venture into the SUV/CUV segment. Having dismissed these vehicles as heavy, rough-riding, gas-sucking and prone to roll-over on the highway - this Edge shatters those perceptions. Looks, ride, power, and a surprisingly roomy interior - this CUV has it all. It achieves a true 18+ mpg in the city and 23+ on the highway, plus it has stability control. Having always been a car or mini-van person, I'm perfectly happy with this Edge.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We fell in love with this car on the first sight and are still happy with it. But there are some points that need to be addressed by Ford. Our engine is whining as another reviewer described earlier. A very annoying high-pitch sound coming from the engine during acceleration and decelleration. The gas mileage is worse than the window sticker promised. We have hard time to make 18npg in the city traffic although we really try hard to drive as careful as possible. A bearing broke after 3000 miles on flat road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle. Do not make the mistake of buying the Edge without the Vista roof. I keep the sunshade open on sunny days and the tinting of the panels is still sufficent as to not bake in the seats. The VR alone gives you the feeling of a much larger interior. Very easy exit/entry and provides great visibility (height) for those who are used to the view from an SUV. Brake, headrest and liftgate concerns from other reviews are non- existant. I will admit that there is a glare reflecting the dash onto the windshield when driving from my Camel interior, but you have to be looking for it to notice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really love this Edge. I have about 1100 miles on this Edge and have had it two weeks. I have had no problems with my brakes they are just fine! The back windows do shake however if you crack the front windows they shake no more. This Edge has more power and rides just as nice as my previous 525I. We bought this Edge because of the leg room in the back seat!! I read about the noise coming from the engine and yes I heard it too however I don't hear it as much now since I hit 1000 miles, probably have to brake in the engine. Gas wise I can't really comment, I live in the mountains and have to climb to 3000 feet 4 times a day! Tank of gas is about a week for me. This Edge is so comfy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 6"3 and loved my Mazda 6 until I started getting lower back pains. I decided to purchase a CUV (need some kind of handling) and well when I saw the new Edge I was hooked! Great exterior design (by far best in class). The drive is not like a sport sedan but for a large vehicle, 4000+ pounds, I was impressed. I purchased full load with Nav which improves the interior look, still not very impressed with interior design and materials. The biggest + is how comfortable and quite this Ford is! Rides like a much more expensive vehicle. The new Duratec is a gem, smooth, quite and powerful. Mated to the 6 speed tranny this Ford is quick! Conclusion: Great value! Great comfort!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband, 6'2" and I, 5'6" both love the comfortable ride. We looked at many crossovers and SUVs before going with the Edge. We did add most of the options including the Vista roof, towing package. We love the power adjustable front driver and passenger seats with the Plus package. Our son has a Honda Pilot and we thought that would be our buy, but the Edge is much sportier and has a quieter, smoother ride. The ground clearance is the same. We did our time with kids and vans so don't need or want the 7 passenger seating vs 5. We compared reviews and specs for the Honda Pilot, Honda CRV, Volvo CX 90, Toyota Highlander, Toyota RAV. Just ran 1600 miles to Las Vegas and back. Great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We prioritized: comfortable ride for 4 active adults with room for golf clubs. Power was a must to be able to run the mountains in Colorado at 70+ MPH. Handling musts are met with the AWD. We love the Vista roof and viewing the mountain canyons is a real treat. Recommend the Sirius and the 9 speakers</FAVORITE>

I do have a serious complaint about this new Ford Edge. For the last 3 weeks I've been seeing red fluid on the ground where I've parked. My husband brought the car to Ford this week and the repair receipt shows "CK red fluid leak, right center firewall area.A/C drain dripping on exhaust bracket causing red rust". It turns out the bracket is rusted from the A/C.The service guy at Ford said he's never seen anything like it. He told us not to park on inclines on days we use the AC.

I tried out 3 different types of vehicles and I was sold on the Edge. My teenagers love it and my 19 year old daughter bought one for her self. We now have 2 in the driveway. Every day someone says "What is that?" Sticker prices were a bit higher than expected, but we got an OK deal during year-end close-out specials.

<TEXT>The Edge is a nice enough vehicle, however try to drive it with the back windows down. You will experience a "shake" like no other. The vibration in the vehicle is so bad the interior door panels shake visibly. Ford acknowledges the problem with a service advisory that states there is no servce at this time. The dealership wants nothing to do with your issue after they receive your money and the solution is don't try to drive it with only the back windows down. Ford states they will not set a precident on this issue with a trade in certificate therefore, your will be stuck. </TEXT>
