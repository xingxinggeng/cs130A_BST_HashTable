<TEXT>No doubt this is the best value car in its class compared to E350, BM530. Trust me, it will carry its resell value. However, there's no such thing as a perfect car since we're only human. Those YOKOHAMA ADVAN stocks tire making way too much noise on the road. LEXUS, please get rid of them, and give us a discount on Michelin PS2. My Yoko still have 60% tread but can't wait to replace them. This is a $47G car, there's no reason for us to just keeping listen to the annoying noise. Nav system should be working 100% of the time. Please give us the code for the Nav, so our passenger could use it at anytime. Overall, this vehicle is still the best buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had driven Lincoln cars for several years prior to buying the GS 350 so the difference in handling was a cultural shock to begin with. Driving the Lincoln was a casual experience while driving the GS 350 is 100% consuming. However, with the purchase of a new set of tires, Good Year Assurance Comfortreads, 225/55/17 the GS 350 behaves like a fine automobile should. I went to the dealer and asked for a new set of Good Year tires and they would not put them on for me. The Dunlop tires were shot at 20 k miles and good riddance. I now enjoy driving the GS 350 for a change. Try the Good Year tires, you'll love them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Initially, I felt a bit cramped moving from an SUV to a car, but then I got used to it pretty fast. Overall, the car performs great and handles very well. The touch screen controls are great and give the car a new and modern look compared to the competition (i.e Infiniti has an analog clock, BMW has late 80s LED displays and a confusing controller). The exterior design is awesome, but the rear does need some improvement to look a bit sportier. Overall, was very reliable. Since mine was a demo, it was put through a lot of use and the only problem it has was with a faulty bluetooth module.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance and handling is great. Amazing acceleration and quietness at the same time. Performs great on mountainous roads.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had an issue with the lights turning off when the windshield wash motor initially turns on. Lexus can't find the issue after several attempts. I also have a problem with the car decelerating when turning a sharp corner. I mentioned this to them several times but they told me that it was the traction control. Now, there is a recall involving the electric power steering which will solve this problem but Lexus doesn't have the parts necessary to fix the three recall items on this car! I will never buy a Lexus again or any luxury car for that matter. It's all a farce. The quality is not much better but it sure does cost a lot more money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had 3 Lexus GS's now and I do say that I love Lexus. Although I do have dash noise as well and I there navigation is unreliable. I have to buy another navigation separate because this one is too hard to function and never takes you in the right place or takes you way out of the way of where you should be going. Also the leather seats seem cheaply painted. I have had the color come off a few times and I wasn't very impressed. But I will say that they drive great and my AWD 350 does get through the snow very well. As far as the Bluetooth I have had no problems I think people are not smart enough to work it... I love mine! Nice looking car as well. But time for something different!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first Lexus and was happy with the purchase. I purchased the vehicle for about $47,000 (loaded). My first problem was with the brakes (excessive brake dust and shrieking) They gave me the 2 option 1-better quality, but noisy or 2-less quality and less noise. Not much of an option. Next problem was the driver side rear mirror. It would get stuck at times. The dealer replace with no charge. Mostly I have been happy with the purchase of a Lexus, but expected less of the annoyances for the price of the car. Wanted to know, what was people reaction after the recall fix to replace the fuel lines? The car sounds very loud, especially when accelerating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've owned five Lexus in my immediate family. Terrific build quality is their primary appeal. The GS 350 awd, in my experience, is a flawed, poorly built car. The front dash was removed and repaired with a "kit" to eliminate creaks and groans. The front breaks howl and produce lots of black dust. A "kit" will be available in Jan., 2009. Handling is no better than the ES 350. I expected a reliable, almost BMW car. I have an unreliable, not quite an ES 350, four door sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The only bad things I have seen that people say about the Lexus GS 350 has to do with the inabililty to use the GPS and Bluetooth systems while driving. Actually, you can use them while driving if you utilize all the options the GS 350 offers you. You only have limited use of the touch screen while driving, but that is what the voice command is for. You can use both the GPS and the Bluetooth to their full advantages if you understand how to use the voice command. You can enter phone numbers and addresses via voice command while driving. Much easier and safer than pushing buttons while driving. Always read directions for your toys before saying they don't work.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned a Lexus GS350 for almost a year now. Overall it is very high quality, and fun to drive. The car does have some drawbacks however. As some others have reported I had problems with an annoying rattle in the dash when it is cold outside, and two trips to the dealer seem to have solved the problem. The other surprise was when I bought the car I discovered soon that it would not sync with my treo 650. Now had to trade my phone for a Motorola Q which works but is a poor substitute as a phone. I thought bluetooth was bluetooth, but would suggest a prospective buyer check the website for compatible phones before the purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love our car. It beats the heck out of our numerous BMWs and MBs. The only car we've had that handles better were our Porsches. This car gets a consistent 25 mpg in mixed driving and 28-30 on the highway. Love the look of the car too! Took the run-flats off immediately and installed studless ice tires and use them year round. A lot less road noise and during the winter don't have to chain up as they are approved (the same as studded tires) for winter driving in Oregon. Haven't seen abnormal wear with the softer rubber and don't have to spend $60 to change out studs in the summer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just an all-around great, comfortable car. Doors close like a 1969 Cadillac (that's a good thing). Performance is terrific, ride is soft but firm (as I like it) I have driven for 10 hours straight (minus bathroom breaks) without having a sore back at the end of the day. FWIW, tested the Cadillac STS, Acura RL and BMW 535i. I have no doubt that I made the right choice with the Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned several luxury sedans over the past 20 years. While all offered excellent driving experiences, there was nothing obnoxious about these vehicles. More recently I was in the market for a new luxury sedan. I looked at the Acura RL for several months but could not get past the uninspired exterior styling. About 6 weeks ago I walked into a Lexus dealer for the first time and fell in love with the GS 350. It was love at first sight and I made the purchase. But, the honeymoon was over in a matter of days. I have since learned this beautiful lady has some serious drawbacks that compromise it?s standing as a serious luxury sedan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It seems Lexus has over looked some ergonomic issues and put lots of energy into over engineering unnecessary safety into many of its subsystems. Unfortunately, these safety features diminish the driving experience one would expect from a $50K automobile. But I love the styling of the GS 350.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our first Lexus. We?ve owned Acuras, BMWs, and Mercedes but the Lexus GS 350 hit the mark for us. The interior styling is absolutely gorgeous, the instrument cluster is one of the best I have seen, the leather trim is smooth and creamy, and the finish on the Red Walnut wood trim is rich and deep. The exterior is also very appealing, especially when you upgrade to chrome wheels. The GS 350 is a real head turner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I buy a car every two years and this was my first Lexus. I have always bought BMW or Mercedes but I thought I would give Lexus a try. I loved the GS 350 AWD design, features and value for the money but was disappointed in the annoying dash board creaks and rattles. The dealer had the car for two days to take the dashboard apart and install the "felt package". I drove off on a 50 degree day in Boston grateful they had fixed it. As soon as the temperature dropped below 40 degrees the dash creak returned. Rather than waste more time on dealer visits I sold the car. I would not buy another Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great vehicle. A little more road noise than I was expecting even with the performance tires. Trunk opening is too small. Vehicle handles great, above average acceleration. Nav system is the pits, you need a comp science degree to figure everything out. Also very annoying that you can't operate the GPS Nav while driving. I know it's a safety feature but should be my choice. As is, it takes away at least 50% of its usefulness. Vehicle is just a tad too small for my taste on the interior.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a former BMW and Mercedes Owner who decided to try a Lexus. I test Drove the GS 350 and realized the ride was "Less firm" than the BMW's but that was to be expected. Unfortunately I only briefly checked out the electronics. I assumed (and you know what that does) that, if anything, the electronics would be better than the BMW. I was Wrong. Not only are the electronics non-intuitive (example, Nav functions are under 3 different top level buttons) but some bureacrat or lawyer in Lexus decided to eliminate most of the functions while the car is moving. This leads to allowing me to "speeddial" someone but disactivates returning a call (and it's the same number of clicks).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sorry, Lexus, but when I bought my car, I told them the two things that made a difference for me was Nav and Bluetooth. I do a lot of driving and talking. I can't get past the fact that both are practically worthless.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's all I expected, and then some. The luxury touches are impressive. I have road noise, but expected it from the 18" wheels/tires. Mileage is great. I run regular gas, and get 26-32 mpg depending (naturally) on driving conditions. I have had BMWs, and would again if it wasn't for their mandated run flat tires. Nothing handles like a BMW, but I knew that when I bought the Lexus. It's a great car (they should offer a bra - even Colgan didn't, and I have stone chips as a result).</TEXT>

<TEXT>After just selling my Mercedes and having owned a BMW as well, the Lexus is a great find. It may not have the status of the European models but the performance and reliability is far superior. The drive is so smooth and comfortable it is easy to go beyond the speed limit. In the long run, I hope that the resale vaue (which is higher) will make my purchase the smartest one yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Lexus (had ES) and first GS. Looks are great but ES is more quiet with road noise and engine noise but car has excellent ride. Tires should be changed from Run-Flat Dunlops to Michelins. Dash sold me for it is perfect fit. Lexus cars ride better with increased mileage.

<TEXT>This is my first Lexus, a GS 350. My previous cars were 335 BMW cpe and 330 BMW, and before those an '05 Viper (can't compare that beast). I test drove the RL, MB 350 and the BMW 550. I made my choice based on comfort, ride, looks and price. It was a toss up with the MB but I took the Lexus at 5k cheaper and w/ more equip. My car was hard to find w/ the ML stereo, silver ext and blk int and only two were available in the entire state with that setup. So far it's great!

I test drove Acura and Infiniti, and there was no comparison in terms of the ride quality (although both were cheaper). The AWD provides superb handling in wet conditions. I have had no noise or rattling problems that others describe.

<TEXT>My wife and I just returned from a 4000 mile trip to the California coast in our GS 350. The car met all my expectations, except for a couple of minor shortcomings. The info screen is too complex for my tastes, it keeps my attention too long when I should have my eyes on the road. The other small annoyance was the sometimes hesitation from the 6 speed transmission. This occured mostly with cruise control engaged. When I bought it, it had 18" wheels/tires which are not as smooth as 17s, but are tolerable and help the handling, which is excellent. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The first thing that I notice about the car is its power. Afterwards you really notice the brakes, yes the brakes can bring this thing to a stop without any fuss. Of course the handling is incredible as well: the GS 350 has monstrous grip and will handle most high speed sweepers quite well. In fact the car may be too good. I once found myself heading into a high speed sweeper a LOT faster than I had anticipated, yet the car sorted itself out. Of course I shouldn't forget the interior, it's luxurious, comes equipped with a number of nice amenities: rear camera, gps, mp3, cd player. Superb car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I would say that the power is really my favorite feature. You can reach some high speeds very quickly. The brakes are of course superb and an invaluable complement to the drivetrain. Also the tires and suspension provide plenty of grip. Of course who can forget the GPS or the MP3 cd player?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is powerful, fast, has a great transmission and is normally fun to drive. However, I had a terrible problem with squeaks and rattles in the dashboard and other interior noises that took all the enjoyment out of driving it. Also, I am not a tall person, but the interior headroom is very limited, even with the seat fully lowered. It is very easy to bump your head getting into the car. My dealer could not fix the noise problem and reinstalled the dashboard so that it did not fit properly around the central instrument cluster. I got tired of hearing the noises everytime there was a bump in the road and after only five months and 6000 miles, I replaced it.</TEXT>

Is it perfect - no, not really. However, no car is perfect. Lexus has their shortcomings, even in a $50k vehicle, however, they do what they can to make things right most of the time. I am very happy with my choice and would purchase it again in a heartbeat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I spent a lot of time comparing the Audi A6 AWD, The BMW 525xi, the Infiniti M35 AWD and the Lexus GS 350. With the new 303 HP engine and the variable all wheel drive, the 5th generation navigation system and Lexus luxury I finally chose the GS 350. It is a wonderful car. It is well designed and an absolute pleasure to drive. I don't want to get out of it. If you haven't driven one and are considering any of the cars I mentioned, you should take it for a spin. I liked the M35, but with the GS 350 also coming in as the lowest "True Cost to Own" it is the right choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>During my most recent 2000 mile road trip I was able to test the GS in both snow and ice. The car is a joy to drive with more than ample power - in fact it provides a bit of an unexpected rush when the pushed. Neither snow or ice provided any impediment to the GS 350, and I was in control even in mountain passes. The gas mileage is close to advertised, and there has been nothing needing correction since purchase. What a difference from my experience with german engineering. Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After years of wishing and wanting I finally got the car of my dreams. A beautiful red with cashmere interior. Although I didn't need the AWD I still decided it might be worth it for the 5-10 days a year we need it here. It has a very solid feel with a good combination of ride quality and handling. Although a little more noise than I thought from road imperfections I am getting used to it. I didn't get the Nav system but the touch sreeen system is very easy to use except for the fingerprints on the screen. I especially enjoy the feeling in the "cockpit" like interior and the fit and finish of all the parts both inside and out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had to give up my '94 SC 400 and needed a sedan. I narrowed my choices to Infiniti G35, BMW 540, Lexus ES 350 and GS 350. The G35 was quick but very stiff. I really liked the ES 350, nice feautres and zippy new motor. Then we drove the GS. I was sold. All the power that my SC had with everything luxury that Lexus us known for. Paid a little more for the GS than the G35 but in my mind, I will be happy for a long time. This car is amazing. Power band from 80-115 is unbelievable. The car shifts at 115 and still has lots of power left. Amazing car performance wise and the ammenities are top-notch. Great value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful car inside and out... and oh, by the way, she's really fast.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Been doing extensive research on this ride for months now. Tossed around idea of the all same class cars - Infiniti, BMW, Audi, Benz, and came back to the GS. Each one had something I liked and disliked but after all chips were in I went with the Lexus. The AWD is the most stable thing ever, even when hammering on the gas in corners! Interior is smaller than previous car for me (5'10" 210lbs) so I will have to get used to it. AWESOME feel to leather, all features within reach, very responsive on gas pedal - almost too much. Gotta love the sound of shutting the door on a Lexus! Only had it 4 days but wanted to put out some feedback. I'm hooked!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather, trim, nav, bluetooth, power, looks (I put 19' rims and tires on it already!) fit and finish. More reviews to follow soon!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have wanted a Lexus GS since it came out many years ago. Finally, after retiring from Big 3, I purchased the car of my dreams. It is beautiful both inside and out, red with tan interior. Even though the trunk is not very big it fits my golf clubs, so not an issue. Car feels very solid/rigid.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is very well done. Touch screen very nice. Powertrain is very quiet as I had expected a Lexus would be.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I bought my GS 350 AWD, I noticed a hard "pull" to the left. I became disappointed in a car that I just spent over 50k on! Well, after 4 trips to the dealership we found out it was the tires! The dealer replaced the Dunlops with Bridgestone tires, and the pull was gone! I LOVE the car again, and look forward to driving it more and more now that I don't have to fight the steering wheel! The only changes I would make are XM radio as standard equipment, and make the steering wheel controls brighter, so that they can be seen at night.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine power, handling, eye appeal, BRIDGESTONE TIRES !!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned my GS 350 AWD since November and love the car. Top notch quality inside and out plus the security of Lexus' exceptional reliability. Very smooth ride, plush interior with not a whisper of outside noise. Every aspect of the interior is thoughtfully planned and purposeful. Initial gas mileage averages around 16 mpg, but this should improve over time. One downside: XM satellite radio is available, but not Sirius, which is a real shame; I find Sirius to be far superor in terms of both programming and songs played. That said, the car is amazing and built to last. Once you drive it, you'll wonder how you lived without it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handsomely designed exterior, the plush interior, the easy to access controls, the smooth, comfortable ride, the safety of AWD and (of course) the Mark Levinson stereo system make this a near perfect automobile.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been driving the GS 350 for two months and have no negative comments. The vehicle handles as well, or better that a previously owned Audi A6 and has much quicker response. The weight to horsepower ration must be just right since the acceleration, even when passing from 60 mph is fantastic. I did have a problem with the hood latch. It would not always release. The nicest sedan I have ever owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Please your wife and please yourself too. Powerful, smooth and refined. Whether you feel like gliding along, city traffic or otherwise, or if you feel like screeching away, this is the car. Boot space is a joke, rear seats don't fold. For those of us living in big cities, parking assist is for real and it helps. Though I liked M35's rearview camera with markings to show where your car would go better. Lexus audio is awesome (Mark Levinson would be nice to show off!). The middle seat in the rear is a little high and uncomfortable. Hump in the rear leg area can be a pain (accept it when you can't settle for anything without AWD). Otherwise rear legroom is great. Do yourself a favor and go get one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>303 HP, handling, braking, parking assist, interior finish/materials, external looks, auto rear sunshade, can easily fit into smaller garages in spite of its size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is almost great. The exterior design is gorgeous and powerful while the inside is luxurious and super comfortable. However, I wouldn't have bought the car without the nav - it's just that good. I didn't, however, opt for the ML sound package because the standard system is pretty darn good. BMWs and Audis are probably more fun to drive hard because of their superior steering feedback, but the GS can hold its own - it handles surprising well for a big car. Dallas has few twisty roads or hills but plenty of hard, concrete highways, so the Lexus' suspension has the best combination of comfort and sport I could find. I wish the back seats folded flat (only has a ski pass-thru), though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power delivery from the 306 HP engine is silky smooth and nearly effortless, you barely feel the transmission shift between its 6 gears, the suspension soaks up all the bumps but still remains athletic, the gadget list is long and includes the best navigation systems, A/C seats are great in Texas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After owning a BMW M3 6spd Conv. and many many repairs and visits to the BMW dealership (only about 3000 miles) I?ve decided to go the sedan route. This GS 350 has it all, looks, performance, features, every thing you could ask for. I love the blue tooth feature, the ventilated front seats and how user friendly this GS 350 is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was this car designed for Little People? Looked at the BMW 530xi, Audi A6, MB E350 and Infiniti M35x and must say, I wish I would have gone with the M35x. It was larger, roomier and just as powerful. What happened to all the space? You cant fit anything in the trunk. Nice looking car, but very uncomfortable drive (6'2). Lexus ruined what I thought was one of the greatest cars on the road. The previous GS 98-05 was amazing! </TEXT>

<TEXT>All, I spent a ridiculous amount of time researching my next vehicle purchase. I traded in my 03 G35 (a great car) for the GS 350. I wanted a larger, more luxurious car that kept the ?go? of the Infiniti. I?ve read all the mags, done Excel comparisons, statistics, test drives, and spoken with dozens of people. When the smoke clears and you?ve tirelessly researched you?ll come back to where you started - if you started with the Lexus GS 350. Five reasons to get this car: value, reliability, fun factor, safety and performance The beauty of this story is that my wife went out and bought the car for my birthday before I could get it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Considering the GS 350? Stop right now & get it! It?s amazing! Most luxurious car in its segment. Ride is flawless & the creature comforts are top notch. I don?t care what magfolk say, I?m not driving the autobahn & I?m not racing. It?s a luxury car that?s sporty & fun. Commuting is a dream. Steering is just fine & much nicer than TL I traded. Yes it does not drive like a German auto, but I don?t care. Just finished a 400+ mile trip & never felt better coming out of a car. Comfortable! Did I mention quiet? Oh my gosh! At highway speeds you can have a normal conversation with music playing in the background. Plus reliability Germany can?t touch. Kudos to Lexus on the GS 350.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort and climate control are amazing. Temperature control precision is remarkable! Plenty of room for tall drivers - 6? and 6?4? fit without issue. Audio is wonderful, satellite is a must. Navi is beautiful. Gauges are beautiful, and interior lighting is cool. BTW, did I mention it is quiet?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is remarkable. The build quality is great. The power-to-weight ratio and electronics smoke. The nav system almost reads your mind. The Mark Levinson audio is a pleasure to listen too as well as the long list of accepted discs. The electric steering is a bit light but not unpleasantly so. I think the car could benefit from the 430's adaptive suspension. The GS 350 AWD is a magnificent piece of engineering!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We test drove quite a few mid-sized luxury, sports /sedans, in the $45k- to $60k range. I have to say, I WANTED a BMW UNTIL I drove the GS 350. This car is fast, beautiful, and hot.Bought one last Saturday. My advice... Lexus has it all. You get much more bang for your buck. As for reliabilty; this is my second Lexus, and if it's as sturdy and dependable as my last one, I won't be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is everything you could ever imagine and more. Hit the gas and it will pin you to your seat. Hit the brakes and it stops as quick as a porche. The interior is about as luxurious as you will ever find. The headlights turn with the steering wheel. The cockpit is far superior to the 530. The navigation system is heads and tails better than the one in my Acura. The rear view camera is excellent and the picture is crystal clear. The park assist even tells you which way to turn the wheel in order to avoid hitting an object. From the outside it looks like a 4 door race car. Everyone stares at it when I pull in a parking lot. WHAT A CAR!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Blows away the previous 2006 GS 300. Lexus addressed the things that made the GS 300 weak! Front brakes are awesome, the engine is powerful and refined. Nav is cleaner and more precise, better voice commands and clarity! Flaws are electronic steering, no feel. I changed tires to bridgestone ploe position re5050a, helped steering feel a lot, handles better and softer quieter ride. But steering still is bland, very little feel! Six speed trans is a little weird, takes some getting used to. Overall, car is refined, reliable, performs much, much better than 06 GS 300. I love the car. Performance-wise it is no BMW, but WAY more luxurious and refined.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 1992 LS 400 which just won't quit but is comfortable and a Boxster which is fun. With the GS 350 I feel I have the best of both worlds, so next week the Porsche goes on sale and the 92 LS becomes my pick up truck. The handling of the GS with 18" summer tire feels honestly as good as the Boxster without the noise and feeling every single crack on the freeway. If it as reliable as my old LS, I will be delighted. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Lexus listened to the reviews of the 2006 model and addressed the concerns in 07 - a quick 303 hp V6; good brake feel and response; the ability to turn off the stability control. I have not enjoyed driving this much since my 1994 BMW 540! I have owned the 2006 530i, and this Lexus is a much better driving experience than that car was. I would like just a bit more headroom (I am 6 feet tall), but that is my only complaint. I am thoroughly enjoying this car - highly recommended for a test drive. </TEXT>
