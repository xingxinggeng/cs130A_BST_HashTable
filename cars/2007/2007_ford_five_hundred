<TEXT>Bought the car new in June 2007 and to date have accumulated over 91,000 miles commuting. Other than a rear brake recall, the car has been flawless. Gets 28+ mpg consistently. Comfortable, quiet, roomy. This car is proof that America can build a reliable vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After reading numerous reviews I was sold on this car. I bought a retired company car (they maintained the car very well), a little high on mileage butwith the excellent shape of the car I thought the maintenance records outweighed the mileage (60k). The SEL has great looks; when I park next to other cars it really is a big car; averaging about 25 MPG; quiet, solid and overall very easy to drive. I paid 10,500; not a steal, but a good deal. Minor complaint: why put an sat. ready radio in the car withour the tuner?? Will cost aout $100 to convert to recieve SIRIUS; stereo is the basic CD-AM/FM and has good sound. Black is very classy, hard to keep clean; but with tinted windows looks sharp.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>very comfortable ride, quiet, hassle free controls, high seating, great crusier on highway, easy city driving, more room than I'll ever use. Last owner installed Michelin Hydro Edge tires 4k B4 I bought: strongly recommend these tires; great grip and no better tires for this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The longer we own this car, the more we like it. We had one problem with abnormal brake wear and Ford took car of it even though it wasn't a warranty item. Handling is very good for such a large car (especially in snow with AWD), ride is excellent and gas mileage has been more than surprising. We got 31 mpg on a recent trip through Arizona and New Mexico. Average mpg in our local hilly/mountain area is 19 city and 26 highway (better than EPA estimate.) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 3.0 liter V-6 give us enough power especially when coupled with the continuously variable transmission. We love the smooth functioning of the powertrain.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my Five Hundred last week and I already love it. Being military I needed a good car to travel from Savannah to Ft Stewart everyday. I love the space, and the powerful V6 engine. The V6 and the AWD combine perfectly when i have one of those days, and wake up a little late.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 1st year of ownership was great, since then we have had the rear brakes recalled because of abnormal wear & grinding under 15000 miles. Power Steering pump went bad, A/C Compressor went bad, power windows quit working, then magically fixed themselves, when I put it in gear it lunges forward if the A/C is running. If my foot is not firmly on the brakes it lunges hard enough to hit something in front or behind the vehicle. And the OEM tires lasted about 35000 miles with regular rotations. It is very comfortable & gets decent fuel mileage in town & exceptional highway mileage for a car of it's size. The shifting of automatic transmission take a little getting used to.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I used to drive an Elantra GT. I started to have leg pains on long drives. I decided to search for a comfortable and safe car. After reading many owner comments about the Ford 500 I decided it was the car for me. There isn't a lot of 500's in my area but I found one with low mileage and in great shape. My wife and I love the car!! Thanks to you owners of 500"s I made a great choice and I look forward to many years of ownership.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 07 Ford 500 back in June 2007. Things have been going ok until Christmas of last year when on vecation car died while driving using cruise control. After this died 3-4 times for the same reason but then only by adjusting speed by cruise controls. After that abnormal wear on back rotors and break pads. Now after 80.000 miles the transmissions seems to starts slipping when go beyond first gear. Car is still at the shop so we will see when they finish with the diagnostics.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's great that reviews like Edmunds knock vehicles that are actually superb examples of engineering and excellent design/functionality. It keeps the prices low!! I purchased my 500 AWD Limited not long ago, used, with 19000 miles. I was looking for a suitable substitute to the mundane and boring SUVs and a departure from the bumpy ride from my most recent leased vehicle, a Dakota 4x4. The 500 is a complete 180 in terms of quality, comfort, utility and style. The interior is totally functional, the visibility is unrestricted and the power from the 3.0 engine is more than adequate for anything beyond a street race (at $2.00+ a gal. for gas, what the heck is so important about speed?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am thrilled with the dependability, comfort, safety, and storage capacity of this vehicle. The present mileage is at 51,000 and have had no problems. Braking system is excellent, Needed new pads at 40K with no other parts needed. I use Mobil 1 for oil changes and the car runs excellent. I recently drove another ford 500 with 12,000 miles and found no noticeable difference in the drive of my vehicle. The only issue is that I am 6'4'' and the leg room could be about 3" longer for my left leg. I can live with this because many of the vehicles that I've sold over the years would be non dependable and I would be walking rather than driving. Average mpg is 23.6 since car was new. WOW. LOVE IT.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great ride, corners excellently, dependable, Roomy, great rear passenger room, easy entering and exiting even if you have severe arthritis in your knees,( not like the poor design of Impala ), many extras, great leather seats, great design and looks, maintains alignment and great MPG</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle as a result of searching for something comfortable after major surgery. Strong engine for a 3.0, CVT is quite cool once you get used to how it operates, AWD is seamless, the ride and handling are comfortable without being bone jarring, controls are well placed. The interior and trunk are cavernous, fit, finish and features are quite good for a car picked up with 19800 miles and going on three years old. Intuitive controls, upward seating position, phenomenal stereo and nav system round out a really cool car. I'm not certain why the automotive reviews were so harsh on this car. I could not disagree more with the reviews out there by the auto critics. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Five Hundred used. At only $16000, and only 13000 miles on the odometer it was a steal. I was checking out Hyundai Sonata's, but I wanted a V6, and had no desire to pay over 20 grand for a car. So I checked out Five Hundreds, I couldn't believe my luck. I always admired the styling of the car, and its safety features. It is roomy and comfortable, gets great gas mileage. I get many compliments on its color and design. Power is great, more than adequate, I mean, come on, how much power is enough? It's fast on the on ramp, good for passing, and corners beautifully. And since I drive mountain roads to get to work, in Calistoga, I love the saftey features and i size. Did I mention MPG?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had three Honda Accords. I decided to buy a used Ford 500 versus the new 2008 Accord based upon value. This car is great. It drives well and has lots of room - lots of compliments from riders about the room. My family enjoys the car, too. Safety ratings were a big reason for purchasing as well. Fuel economy has been very good. Consistently 20-21 in town. On the highway between 29 and 32 (I did get 32.5 on one trip). Overall, this is a great car. Although many in the press have not given favorable responses, many owners like me seem to think this is a highly underrated car - a diamond in the rough. SEL package is nicely equipped. Great A/C system in hot climate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am an insurance adjuster and this is my company car and I drive it hard. I currently have about 67000 miles on it and have had numerous problems with it mechanically. At 30K the trans began shifting hard, took it to the dealer and had the throttlebody replaced. At 50K the steering was loose and was pulling hard, had the left lower ball joint (which only came with the control arm) and the steering gear replaced. At 65K the same trans problem and they again replaced the throttlebody. Another adjuster has had similar problems with the steering/suspension. Also, 3.0 is not that powerful. You might have better luck as an everyday commuter instead of a workhorse like me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After four months of ownership I must admit I've been very pleased with this car! It does have a few shortcomings but I'm happy with my purchase decision. Two things stand out in this model, unlike the Chrysler 300, visibility is terrific, secondly and something I've really come to appreciate is the easy in and out feature of its SUV like interior. You don't fall into the car like you do with so many others, you just kind of slide into the seat. Many so-called professional reviewers have knocked the 500 for its lack of power. So far I have not felt the need for more power, nor would I care to give up its excellent mileage for a little more speed. I do find the shifting habit of the six</TEXT>

We test sat/drove many vehicles of all makes including the 2008 Taurus and the Five Hundred was the only one I didn't have my head touching the roof when sitting in back. Ours is a 2007 Five Hundred Limited FWD in white/pebble and we love it! Is it the most luxurious car we've ever owned? no. The sportiest? no. But it is perfect for us. Room aplenty, smooth ride, good gas mileage, adjustable pedals, thoughtful features, classy looks, good build quality. We're just happy we got one before they were all gone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car about a month and starting to really like it. I was surprised that the driver's seat raises up high enough for me. I have had SUVs the last couple of times and at first was concerned that a car would be too low. I love the sides and back, but the front of Ford's vehicles aren't that sharp. Inside is great -- lots of extras. Only negative is power. I did not get AWD, so I have the regular transmission. I previously had the CVT in a Freestyle and got used to the smooth shift. The Five struggles with the a/c on and I have to remember not to pull out in front of anyone. I mean 206 hp for a 3700 lb vehicle is ridiculous.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I moved into this car from an '07 IS250 and have never looked back. While it is not the same Tron-like driving experience, I could not ask for a more appropriate car for travelling with my family. It has all the space we need, decent mpg and is amazingly comfortable for short or long trips. We chose this over a SUV because the large trunk will keep items from hitting the kids if we are ever rear-ended. We were already t-boned once by a RAV-4 whose driver had a senior moment, and we were able to drive away with no injuries and less damage than she had. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car on my brothers advice. I've had two previous Taurus's. I've had this car for 5 days. So far I drove home in a bad rain storm and had great handling on wet road. Highway power was good, I had not problems passing or going up hill. I drove to KC and got 28 MPG driving around 78 MPH. I felt this was good. My 2001 Taurus got 30 MPG and is a lighter car. I feel safe in this large car. It is very comfortable and I can see out, I'm 5'3" so that is important. I love the rear seats folding down. I transported a dog without fear of ruining my leather seats. I'm still learning where all the features are. I had a bad alternator from wire glitch, a bummer but..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats. Power everything. Large back seats that lay down, very cool! Huge trunk. Great color, fire red. 29 MPG. Power to spare. Impressive handling. I felt safe and large!

<TEXT>The acceleration is great, once you get use to the CVT transmission. It handles like a nS80 Volvo. Gas mileage so far at 24 mpg on my 44 mile round trips to work. Lots of room, wish the front seat went back about another inch. (I am 6'5") Good head room and I love the adjustable brake and gas peddles. Air bags everywhere, even in the canopy. Facts you need to know. The 3.0 duratec engine is from a Porsche designed 2.5 (Ford bored it out to 3.0) the AWD is the Haldex system from Volvo. Suspension is also Volvo derived from the S80. 0-60 is under 8 seconds. CVT transmission is German designed and built from ZF transmission group. Very underrated car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All in all, very little to complain about after 5000 miles. Factory CD failed on first use, but replaced. Very comfortable to be in, although larger drivers may find their right leg too close to the center console. Complaints by critics about styling/power have proven unwarranted. People like the look of the car and haven't found acceleration lacking with CVT/engine pairing. Handling is OK, not great, but ride is better than that. It is not silent at highway speeds, but not really a problem. Plenty of interior storage, huge trunk, elevated seating position; it's (mostly) all good.</TEXT>

So easy to get in and out of and it is still so new I want to drive it a lot. My mileage is still not great (about 17.4) and I do hope it improves. So far, all things are working great. I will make the dealer align the car at the first service, but that is the only thing I have noticed. Really nice, plain, and high class automobile. Will drive it happily and feeling safe. </TEXT>

The 3.0, while not a screamer so to speak, does provide enough oompf to get motoring on the surrounding super highways. Have nearly 10K miles and not experienced any problems to date. The only down side is we expected the fuel economy to be a little better, but being a car of this size, it's not really that disappointing. Overall we would buy it again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really like driving this car a lot, it handles very well and rides smooth and quiet. This car is very roomy inside for the family and has a huge trunk. The Continental Tires that came with it were garbage, good for summer and smooth roads, but horrible in wet/snow/icy conditions. I put a complete set of Goodyear TripleTred on it and it handles great in the wet/snow/ice conditions as well as a bit more responsive on turns. This car replaced our Grand Prix and it gets a little better MPG and still has the getup and go, but a lot/lot/lot more room inside. We have the individual temp control for driver/passenger which also came w/6cd MP3 player/superior sound system, a nice addition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. Very surprised when I got into the car on how nice it was. Hugs the road, quieter than Taurus (last car) but they need to do even better. For the money a GREAT VALUE. Heated front seats, split temp control, reverse sensors, nice leather, 6 disc in dash changer, Sirius radio, 8 way adjustable seats, 2 memory buttons to recall driver cockpit settings. FAST. I went to look & ended up buying my 1ST new car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof. Leather, AWD, high ceiling in cabin - I am 6'2'' and have (finally) enough room. Still learning the rest. Driven it all of 21 miles so far.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is super comfortable, and gives wonderful visibility. It is quiet in the interior, and goes great in the snow, without AWD. The safety feature is a bonus. Very nice car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 500 is the only sedan I could get into with a huge trunk and interior for less than $25K loaded up. The styling is generic but not offending. The 3.0 liter engine has good highway passing power and far from being underpowered. The ride and handling are ok but steering could be a little firmer and more direct. Shame on Ford for removing the door protection moldings. I will have to see if the dealer can install them aftermarket.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My new 500 with all chrome accessories is shiny black and fun to drive. The only thing I don't like is the soft suspension. Turning quickly makes the car sway left, and right, but driving on a highway with the CD blasting at any speed everything is fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife & I love this 500 which we ordered. The Alloy paint with the 18 inch chrome wheels & saddle leather interior really set this 500 off & make it an eye catching car. She especially likes the great view of the road when driving & the spacious rear seating area. What a huge trunk. This replaced a 2002 Taurus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the AWD version to replace a small SUV which got horrible highway mileage. I have been very pleased with the Ford 500. It gets 21 in town, 24 in mixed city/highway driving and will get about 32 mpg when driven at 65 on the highway. Highway mpg's vary between 27 and 34 depending upon speed driven and wind. It is great for hauling large items such as 300 pounds of horse feed and recently a table and chairs. Handling is pretty good, excellent brakes and outboard visibility, fine acceleration for merging and passing (contrary to some reviews-it goes plenty fast without straining). The steering is a bit floaty, worse in the front wheel version. Very comfortable interior. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reliable AWD, great safety cage and airbags, love moonroof. adequate head and leg room. So happy to have decent mileage for both economic and ethical reasons. I think the car is pretty. Like practical, somewhat minimal interior. Love fold flat back and front passenger seats. CVT engine is smooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>New alloy color, tinted windows and the Pirelli tires turns heads. Excellent handling & ride. Glad for the fuel economy of the 3.0L engine. I'm sure the 2008 w/3.5L will be more fun to drive. Incredible value for family still raising kids. Nicely done.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy. Back seat & trunk space are outstanding.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car meets all my requirements: minimal blind spots, excellent fuel economy, comfortable on a long trip, lots of cargo space, 5 star crash ratings, reasonable price. It is enjoyable to drive. It is not underpowered and merges, climbs hills and passes with no trouble at all. The headlights are better than many other cars. It is a safe size here in the land of huge trucks and huge SUV's. (I do most of my driving in Texas and Oklahoma where more trucks than cars are on roads) The all wheel drive is wonderful in both a heavy snow storm and a heavy rainstorm. The brakes are excellent. Heater, air conditioner and defrosters front and back are top of the line. This also matters a lot here.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driver info/messenger center with mpg, distance to empty, trip meter etc. I like having a compass and external temp. Fantastic all wheel drive, great headlights and perimeter lighting. the cargo and passenger room. 5 year, 70,000 mile warranty is great. 30-33 mpg highway at 65 mph, 27 at 70mph.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Comfortable, lots of interior/trunk room. Sharp looking vehicle. However the engine is too small for such a big car. Hit the gas and takes too long for engine response (hesitates)when passing. Must have something to do with that new CVT transmission. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I keep hearing that this vehicle needs a bigger engine...don't agree. The 3 liter engine is fine 95-98% of the time. (If I lived in the middle of the Rocky Mountains I might lower that % but most of us don't!). The 6 speed transmission downshifts more than one is used to but you quickly learn to work with it. Even in 5th gear, engine speed is close to what many other cars are in their "top gear". I bought this car because it's a full size sedan with a sensible engine size and I'm very happy with it. I love to cruise along at 70 MPH, 2000 RPM and get mileage that hangs around 30 mph...a whole lot better than my Lexus ES300!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took on a trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and couldn't ask for a better ride. About a 1200 mile round trip, getting almost 29 miles per gallon. Had no trouble passing or getting up the grades on cruise control. I would definitely buy another Ford product.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The main reason that I purchased the 500 was the driving character of this car. The ride of this car equals that of the more expensive models.The total design of this car inside and out is what people use to expect of Ford. The 500 is a great value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first drove the 500, it was a pleasant experience. My first impression was that it was a nice, large sedan that handles well, despite the "plain brown wrapper" design. Then I drove back home. I live in a rural area on a dirt road. All the roads in my area are dirt. Dirt turns to mud, and that's when the 500 starts to slip and slide. It is terrifying to drive this car on anything other than smooth, dry pavement. Big problems in the handling. Yikes! Also, my knees bump the dash. I'm short, so by the time the seat is up far enough, there is no leg room left.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Really roomy interior and amazing trunk space. Nice instrumentation. User friendly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought a 500 while looking for a Charger. When we saw the 500 my husband fell in love with it. The seats are very comfortable and roomy, especially the back seats. I am rather tall, and can cross my legs and ride comfortably in the back. The woodgrain interior is beautiful. I like the backup signal feature, it helps when my teenagers are parallel parking. We really like the CVT. It rides so smoothly on the highway, accelerates smartly, even going up a steep hill, and you do not feel the gear change. I am very happy with the 500. I thought I really wanted a Charger, but I am not a bit disappointed with the 500, in fact, I am thrilled with it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I travel in work all the time. The mark of a great car is not the racy numbers but how well do you feel after a lengthy trip? How comfortable were you along the way? Is there enough room to "take it with you?" How is the interior laid out? I can tell you that taking a trip in a Five Hundred sedan will be an experience unmatched by anything else in its price class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior ROOM layout and many places to put important things. The seating and visual stance. This car 'rides-drives-handles' like a champ!</FAVORITE>
