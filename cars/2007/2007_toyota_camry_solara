<TEXT>Car has chronic problem with pulling to right, front windows bang when they go down into door and the dealer says that is normal as the car ages. The car does not handle roads very well, there are lots of rattles and ride's very rough. I have owned several Toyota's and this is by far the worst Toyota I have ever owned. I know that everyone who writes loves theirs but I can't say the same. The dealer and Toyota specialist keep telling me that I'm too fussy and all the problems are in my head. Friends that drive the car agree that there is something wrong but I can't seem to get Toyota to agree with me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Speed of power top going up / down and size of the trunk is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just the looks of this Solara coupe sold me on the car. It also did not hurt that it got 9's and above from used car owner reviews. It looks great standing still and the 4 cylinder sips gas. I averaged 33 on the highway driving it home from Florida. Roomy back seat for a coupe. We love it and hope it lasts a good long time. It is roomier than the Accord or the Altima and that is another reason we picked it. Too bad they are no longer in production. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks very sporty yet it sips gas like an economy car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my Toyota Solara SLE Convertible for just about three years now. I absolutely love it! I was so very sorry to hear of the model's demise. I think Toyota made a mistake there. I wanted a 4 seater not a 2 seater convertible without being a huge car and there are not many of those made. The retractable hard roofs take up trunk space which I do not like. My car has really good trunk space. I have seen too many of the convertibles with very poor trunk space. I would have continued buying Toyota's convertibles if they had continued making the Solara. I live in the middle south and convertibles are definitely the way to go. Toyota: PLEASE BRING IT BACK!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the way the car handles. Plus, it has a smooth ride. I had a Corvette once and felt every tar bump on the road. Much prefer my Solara Convertible. Plus I love the color (Cosmic Blue) and have had MANY, MANY complements. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had a Solara for over 2 years now. It is a great car! I don't get as many admiring looks as I did with my MR2 Spyder, but it definitely gets noticed. It rides well and is very quiet. The back seat accommodates 2 adults easily and it has ample trunk room. The V-6 is very responsive and I have to be careful about speeding. I have had no problems with it. Only visits to the dealer for routine maintenance. If I ever have to replace it, I will definitely have this model at the top of my list.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my car in march and absolutely loved it. I noticed in august my passenger window didn't always stay rolled up and then my car wasn't always starting. It would eventually start but the dealership just made me feel as if i was crazy or somehow at fault. Unfortunatley, as is with most issues, not everything can be duplicated at the dealership and I've had my car in the shop at least once a week since November. It's now a week before Christmas. Since my car is under warranty, I hope this issue is resolved before my warranty ends.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The bluetooth and the miles to empty meter. I'm a musician and my cello fits perfectly in the trunk. Its great when I'm carpooling. I've actually fit 2 cellos a violin and 4 people in my solara. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The problems that are popping up are rather disappointing. We have a 2007 Toyota Solara convertible with HID head lights. The head lights work when you first turn them on but one goes out after 10 seconds and the other goes out after about 20 minutes. I was floored when they stated the bulbs were $368.00 each, and they did not stock them. I went to an auto parts store and purchased a bulb for $89.00 but it did not fix the problem. I took it to the dealer to repair the lights when they informed us that it would cost $2000 to repair the system and it was not covered as our car has 40,000 miles on it and I voided because I put in an after market bulb. The problem has not been fixed yet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The great gas mileage, the rear seat has the roomiest of any convertible I have ever seen and it fits two full sized adults</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this brand new two weeks ago, and boy what fun! I love to go topless, yet cannot believe how quiet it is when the top is up! It's so much fun to drive and handles so well. It took me months to find one though and I had about given up looking. I hear it is being discontinued? What a shame, as the SLE model just doesn't have the "sporty" look to it. If you can find one - buy it quick. I may be 60 but I still want the "sporty" look - and this one has it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth feature (was a must for us in Calif.); the instrument panel with lights on; very classy metallic paint; rear spoiler (my favorite); underbody trim to add to the sporty look; ease of putting top up/down; adjustable headlamps; comfortable back seat; roomy trunk, and Toyota reliability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There isn't a better car available that exudes luxury and sport. It turns heads every day and is often confused with a Lexus. It does not have the Mustang's get-up (but is that really necessary anyway?), nor does it have the Lexus price-tag (but it still comes with most of the goodies). It's handling is smooth, the ride is velvety and the engine is near silent when running. Granted, its price is a wee bit on the high end, but keep in mind that just comes with the territory when you buy something as reliable, safe and with excellent re-sale value as a Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've enjoyed my Toyota Solara, except that at EVERY oil change it's been 1 quart low of oil. We took it to the dealer for an oil consumption test and were told that it's normal for it to consume that amount of oil every 5,000 miles. I've never driven a new car that I had to put oil into at that rate. It doesn't seem to be leaking, but still concerns me. Other than that, it's a comfortable car that handles well. View over the shoulder is a bit obstructed, but you can use your mirrors if adjusted properly. 6CD changer has already been replaced once by factory and appears to be going out again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Beautiful, smooth ride & very fun to drive, this car is just about perfect to me. Living in New England, it's difficult for a car to accommodate the extreme demands year-round, but this car has for me. I knew when I bought it that I wouldn't be happy with the blindspots in back but purchased it anyway. I've owned a variety of automobiles to use as a comparison and can honostly say that I love my Solara convertible and am reminded of that everythime I drive it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Toyota Solara V6 SLE coupe is a joy to drive with the exception of several rattles and squeaks in the interior. I have tried to attribute these rattles to a particular item, but cannot. They are intermittent and they change. I am disappointed that this otherwise flawless vehicle sounds a bit junky at times with only 6500 miles on it. What will it be like 3 or 4 years from now?</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Solara V-6 is a very efficient vehicle providing approximate 36 miles per gallon. At this time, after replacing the air filter for a high flow filter I am getting about 400 miles per tank of fuel on the highway. Yes it is a 3.3 V-6! The vehicle has enough power for a mid size and is very comfortable for a two door, two adults fit on the rear seats without compromising comfort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Solara rag top is an overall excellent product. Superb build quality. I'm getting 29.5 MPG on the highway. This is a great car for the money. Smooth as silk. This car just glides.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Solara and I love it! The vehicle is not a "sports" car, not good for those who want the (unnecessary) acceleration and zip of other sport cars. This is more of a cruising/touring vehicle. Feels like a hot knife through butter on the road, velvety ride, smooth handling. Handles very luxuriously and the sport trim adds a little more pizzaz with the interior carbon trim (as opposed to woodgrain), sport pedals and ground effect. Very quiet on the road, top up or down. Bluetooth is impressive even with the top down on the interstate - conversations are easy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Level-adjustable HID headlights, steering wheel controls, smooth and quiet ride, comfort. Toyota's reputation! Blizzard pearl paint is simply stunning. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Living in Ohio I was nervous about buying a convertible but this car handles as good in the snow as the Taurus I owned before it. I bought my car in the winter and I felt no drafts. The best options about the car are the heated front leather seats, large back seat that comfortably seats adults, and the large trunk size. These are rare options to find in a convertible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall this is a very good car. Acceleration is very good. the interior is Lexus like quality. With the top up, it's almost like any sedan. there is some body shudder but only under unusual circumstances. The switch for the top is in a VERY bad place and isn't lighted. Same for the "all up" window switch. There is only one power outlet that's useful, the other is in the bottom of the console. rear window pillars are huge, making backing out of a parking spot an adventure. The trunk is actually useful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the vehicle in August 2006 and have been very pleased with it overall. I agree with others that it would be nice if you could see behind you a little better, but after all this is a convertible. I have owned several Toyotas and their construction and performance has always been excellent. The only problem I have had is that on rough roads the brake pedal rattles a little and at times it is difficult to start. But I am sure that after I take it in to a dealer they can solve the problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got the Solara convertible SLE and we are extremely satisified. Traded in a 2003 BMW Z4 that was fun to drive but suffered from some strange quirks. The Solara is a different kind of ride, somewhat sporty but rather refined. The fact that it can carry 4 in comfort and the huge trunk are both real positives. Also, the built in bluetooth phone system is fantastic. Seats are very comfortable and the controls are typical Toyota, well designed and intuitive. Paint job is awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I had the car for 6 weeks with 2500 miles. The car is very quiet, solid, and lives up to Toyota quality. I traded a 3 BMW and the Solara is as quiet and comfortable as the Bimmer. I was impressed as to how quiet the ride is with the top up and also with the top down. The navigation system is a bit busy but it keeps my wife occupied during out short trips to the beach. I'm happy I bought the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ease of putting the top down, the sound system, very comfortable seats, fairly large trunk, large back seats, and quality of workmanship of the whole car. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Sorry I bought it</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>The 4cyl is a clumsy and unrefined engine that ruins an otherwise good car. Poor engine controls, driveablity, hesitates badly often and wants to stall when it is cold (warming up) leads to an unhappy driving experience. Have been back to the dealer several times and I'm told the car is operating normally, and I should drive it "more aggressively". I bought the 4 to save gas, not beat on it. Combined hwy/cty or city only mpg is worse than my old, big 6 that I traded in. Hwy mpg is ok. I've had other small issues that the dealer took care of. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very pretty car, really nice blue/tan interior combo. Sunroof adds some open air comfort without too much wind roar. Roomy and comfortable, especially for two people traveling. Sound system is a definite plus, sounds great! Big trunk and seats that fold down in back is a nice feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the car. Very fun to drive. The top goes up and down easy and fast. One negative is that the passenger seat is not automatically adjustable and is not as comfortable. I did not notice this when I bought it. Gas mileage is about 17 miles to the gallon. The car handles well but sometimes going around a corner fast it seems to lose grip on the road a little. I would buy this car again. Looks great and seats 4 adults easy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, we love it. We wanted a convertible that could seat four comfortably, and have enough cargo space for golf clubs. It is smooth, quiet, and comfortable. Mileage is okay. Putting the boot on is kind of a pain, and our side clips don't stay in place. Visibility is restricted with top up or down as boot blocks rear view of close objects. My husband doesn't like the low visor position, especially with seat forward.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned many cars, but this is my first new Toyota. Given their reputation, I thought this would be a good car to get. So far, it's been a disaster. Stalled, rough engine all around (especially on warm up) and dealer finds no problems. Lugging and poor engine performance on turns and on upshift. Reset computer to no avail. There is a fix, but only for the '07 Camry that has the same problems. Not available for the Solara yet, if ever, they tell me. Severe rainwater leaks not only from cowl, but both doors as well. I've gotten used to driving loaner cars, it spent two weeks in the dealership just getting those leaks fixed. MPG on dash shows around 28 steady, actual can be as low as 19. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice looking car, comfortable seats, quiet ride. Sound system is excellent. Lots of compliments when I have the car. Auto dimming mirror w/compass is nice, but could react faster. Seat belts have cool extenders from the shoulder mounts making them comfortable to wear for all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had my choices narrowed down to a Camry XLE four cylinder and the six cylinder Solara Sport. The dealer was offering them both at the same price and I was leaning towards the Camry in my head and the Solara in my heart. I could not go wrong either way. I've had the Solara for a month LOVE it! The ride and handling are great and I really like the looks both inside and out. The power is great, but I also don't mind the DC rush hours when it is stop and go. I will recommend the car to anybody who asks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have put about 3,000 miles on so far and they have all been fun miles. It rides like a luxury sedan but handles like a sports car.As sporty as this car is though, it is not a small car. It is extremely comfortable up front, has a very fuctional rear seat that two adults can fit in easily and comfortably and a very adequate trunk for a convertible, as large as many sedans of this class. These were all high on my "needs" list. It is quieter than I expected a rag top inside. It has very good acceleration and passing speed and the trans shifts flawlessly and effortlessly. I would recommend this automobile highly to anyone looking for the "topless experience" without sacraficing comfort</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent road lighting with the optional headlight package, the Bluetooth phone feature and the navigation are very convenient, the ease and speed of the top opening and the "all windows" button make it easier to convert to rag-top mode, the "in steering wheel" radio & display controls are great</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Did two test drives. Took delivery only 3 days ago. Didn't think I would trade my 2001 Mustang convertible for anything other than a mustang GT, but I did. Solara convertible is great compared to mustang GT if you don't mind 90 hp less and better than the Pontiac G6 which gives 0 trunk space with top down. Solara has just about everything including a gps option and automatic/clutchless manual shifting (very fun). Watch the backing with the boot on - you lose almost all rear view visibility with the high boot unless you are very tall and put the seat in a high position. Have already reported this safety problem to Toyota. Would not have been a deal breaker, but maybe better discount.</TEXT>

As soon as I saw the 2007 Solara, I knew that I wanted this car. It is very stylish, powerful and comes with features that anyone would love. It is a very fun to drive car and you don't see too many of these cars around either. The price is certainly better than the other competitors. I love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Quality and reliablity: After four days of owning my car and going on a 2 hour trip, one way, I noticed the carpet soaking wet on the driver's side. The service dept. kept asking me if I drove over any huge puddles or if it rained on the car. I replied, "No." They concluded there was a gap in the material used on the fender where water leaked into the car. I replied the only water that was put on the car was when they washed it the day I bought it. Performance: Smooth and quiet ride great pick-up but jerks when I accelerate after applying the brakes when slowing down to turn a corner. Design: I'm not crazy about the side view of the car -too sloped toward the back end. </TEXT>

<TEXT>First rate vehicle. Fun to drive, easy to care for. Quite quiet for a convertible. A little difficult to get out of the back seat. Rear visibilty could be better. Overall a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although I just purchased this car yesterday, I already know it is a much improved version of the 2004 model that I traded in. The ride is tighter, smoother and not jarring as it was in my 2004. This may sound trivial, but my 2004 had a "weird" smell in it since the day I bought it. This new one actually smells like a new car!</TEXT>
