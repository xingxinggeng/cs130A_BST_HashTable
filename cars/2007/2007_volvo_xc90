<TEXT>This is my first experience with Volvo and for the most part it is a great one. The XC90 V8 is impressive and fun to drive. The styling of the exterior far out weights it competitors. I can no longer go back to the Japanese cars I drove in the past. They all now seem so cheap. I have had a few problems with my XC90: rattling noises (drive me crazy), front dash crackles during change in temperature (very common in Volvo's) but go away when temperature regulates and a strange transmission whine at 55 mph (being resolved). In Short I trusted the Japanese cars for their reliability, so that's why I chose the V8. Japanese (Yamaha)engine and transmission wrapped up in a luxury SUV. I love mine!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Now have 17K miles. Had to replace tires. No other problems. Ditto first review only better. Especially now that Volvo has discontinued the V8 engine. Big mistake. Much better then the six at the expense of only a few MPG. If your buying this for the MPG you can do much better. If your buying this just for the pleasure, comfort and fun of the powerful V8, you'd be hard pressed to find something better. Great world class vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>One of the worst performing all wheel drive vehicles ever owned. Tires wore out within 18,000 miles, traction is terrible in snow and even on wet roads. Tire dealers comment on how poor the all wheel drive systems are and suggest changing to snow tires for the winter months. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first choice in SUVs. I absolutely love it. With 3 kids and after trading in the minivan, this suv is a little smaller. But it is so much fun to drive (compared to the van it's like driving a sports car) that I don't mind the little amount of space lost. It gets great gas mileage - the same as my van, 19 in town and 22-23 on the highway. It is easy to maneuver in small spots, easy to park. My only regret is that i didn't buy one sooner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The girls and I love the sunroof. The radio is nice, better sound quality than my van. And I love the seat position memory. Pressing one button to get it back the way I like it after my husband drives. It is a lot better than moving the seat and mirrors manually.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our 07 XC in 2007 brand new. The truck has been OK , but not what I expected from a $45,000 car. It has good seat comfort and driving position but it also feels a lot bigger than it actually is. The car has decent acceleration, but nothing to write home about. The best thing about the car is the brakes witch stop you on a dime! The 3.2 our car has is a little bit thirsty and doesn't give as much power as I would like. Our average mpg (mostly city driving) is around 16.5 (on road trips we've gotten up to 22). The 3rd row seat is tight but easily moved out of the way! The transmission is great especially the manual option! Overall it has been a good car but could be better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In 2006, after our second child, we were looking for a good looking SUV with a 3rd row option. We narrowed the list now to the Lexus LX, Benz GL and the Volvo. Test drove them all, and kept coming back to the Volvo. The Swedish ergonomics were very nice. Everything was in its proper place. Electronics are tricked out, and the price was reasonable. After 2yr, 24,000 miles, I have zero complaints, only praise. I have had zero mechanical failures (very surprising). </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have three XC90s in the family and the V8 is by far my favorite. The Yamaha engine never runs short on torque. The acceleration between 50-80 mph is amazing. The minor improvements to the interior are subtle but affective. I especially appreciate the iPod jack. The handling is awesome with plenty of room for the family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife has extreme Volvo loyalty and she bought this XC90 3.2 FWD straight base model in spite of my reluctance. I pondered a Kia Sedona, but couldn't bring myself to close the deal on that because I was doubtful the mpg would meet my minimum requirement. With my inaction going on indefinitely she bought this XC90, and I took her 2004 V70 base model with which I get 30 to 35 mpg on the highway at 70 to 80 mph under best driving conditions. The XC90 fuel use has been acceptable on the highway (22 mpg to over 26 mpg), but lower than I would like at 15 mpg in short trip usage in town. Total fuel economy over the first 12,000 miles has been 19 mpg. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Very dissapointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>We trade in our 2006 XC90 to take advantage of a great offer on the new 2007 when it came out. Big mistake. We really liked our 2006 and only had minor issues with it. It drove well and was a good performer. Our 2007 has been a disaster. It has had a horrible ride since day one. It has been in the shop for almost 7 weeks in the first 18 months we have owned it. Both front axle shafts have been replaced, power steering issues along with numerous minor items. Even now, the car jolts over any bump and rides so loudly it is hard to talk in the car. At least it looks nice and we only have a two year lease. Volvo has tried to fix it, and the dealerships have been pleasant, but we give up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Even after five years, it is still the best looking SUV on the road. Interior materials hold up very well even with two kids in carseats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased a 2007 AWD 3.2 Volvo XC90 in August of 2006. I am so glad that I chose a 24 month lease as opposed to a 36 month lease. We have 2 more payments to go, and can't wait to get out of this car. I knew the car wasn't all that fun to drive, but was surprised that it would be as unreliable as it has been. </TEXT>

<TEXT>First XC90 was 2003 T6. Gas hog and poor performance. Traded it in on a 2006 V8 AWD, used, dealer special. Traded that in for a 2007 V8 AWD, new, because I wanted a Nav system and I love the new Titanium Metallic Grey color with black interior. 2007 best of the lot and a Wednesday car built. Powerful,smooth, comfortable, great sound system, excellent visabiltiy, fun to drive and solid as a tank. 6200 miles and no problems. Truly a world class vehicle. Looked at a Mercedes M, BMWx5, MDX and Volvo was the best of the group. Most power and most cargo room. You can spend a lot more money and you can't buy a much better vehicle. </TEXT>

We love the two-piece rear gate as we have a dog who hops onto it as well as stays in on warmer days with the lower gate closed. main reason for buying was safety and looks. looked at BMW (X3 too small; X5 too expensive), Acura (tacky), Infiniti (weird), merc (unreliable?).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just new to Volvo after driving Japanese for all my life (except Audi for a wonderful 3 years). Compared to previous MDX and 4-Runner, the XC90 has all the luxe one would expect at this price. Great seats, simple control-layout, great ride, decent power and capabilities. Low road noise and nice, high perch. Great grocery bag feature at back that beats a cargo net hands down. Handsome exterior design.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I am satisfied with the car. On many levels it compares well with other imported SUVs, and is more reasonably priced than many of them. The cargo room it provides is quite good. 2nd row seating is tight front and aft when the third row option is installed. Volvo has a very skimpy maintenance plan, comp. to others', just the first is free. Gas mileage: try as I might, never more than 17mpg. A BMW X3 is much quicker and with beter mileage. Reliability: the shift lever will not leave park on cold days for up to 1min. Even a "fix" didn't help. Traction: Problems with 4wd engagement led to recall, but mine still spins through in FWD on even just slightly wet surfaces. Very annoying</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Controls for climate, sound, etc are laid out well, and once you know them, can be operated by touch without looking for them every time (many new cars don't have that any more). Under seat heating ducts for the back pass. Do not use these yet, but the kid-booster and third row are nice features</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I purchased our 2007 XC90 3.2 in April of 07. We have had multiple problems with this vehicle including a chronic rattle (5 weeks in the shop), a defective DVD entertainment system (almost caused a fire), improper oil change (1 1/2 quart low)and a stress cracked windshield / improperly installed from factory (took and act of God to get Volvo to take responsibility for). While the build quality of this vehicle and design of the XC90 looks good, we have experienced many problems that should not have occured in a vehicle in this price range. We would not recommend Volvo and particularly the dealership we worked with.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>When we are not finding problems with our XC90, we do enjoy driving it. The 3.2 liter engine is underpowered, or at least our is (the demo I drove with the same engine we much quicker- go figure).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I saw this car at a dealership and bought it as a birthday gift for myself. First Volvo and I love to drive it. The V-6 has plenty giddyup on the interstate. The third row seats give you flexibility and stows away nicely with a cargo mat when not in use. The XC is large enought to get the job done and stylish enough to look good doing it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an '06 T5 after driving a Honda Accord EX-V6 for 7 years and immediately fell in love with the Volvo fit and finish. I originally wanted a V8 but thought the T5 would get much better gas mileage - wrong! Then I saw the V8 Sport on the road and knew I would have one soon. What I didn't realize was how different the T5 and V8 Sport would be. The growl of the V8 is awesome, the Sport exterior and interior is phenomenal, and all the extras from the Technology/Climate and Convenience packages are to die for. Forget the others. This is the vehicle I will drive everyday for the next 10 years or so, no matter the price of gas - it's worth it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The V8, the 19" Vulcanis rims, the so-cool active Bi-Xenons, the immensely comfortable seating, the blue instrumentation, the deafening sound system with complimentary Sirius, and the overall fit and finish.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since I purchased the wagon 45 days ago, I have put 3,000 miles on with no problems. The wagon runs smooth and quiet with power when needed. This is the first V8 I have purchased so I had to get used to the reduced gas mileage. There should be no expectations for great gas mileage with a 5,000 pound vehicle. Design, fit and finish are unmatched. This is my 3rd Volvo I have purchased. If the design and quality continue, I can see myself hooked for life.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Quality construction, great reliability, excellent acceleration, eye catching design, only the Cayenne can compare (exterior design). Improve stereo sound quality (lacks richness and depth). Interior functionality (design, seats, storage, cupholders, tailgate) is genius, spartan in an exquisite sort of way. No wasted electronic frills, paint quality is superior, braking exceeds expectations. Lives up to the Volvo name and tradition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the XC90 3.2ltr FWD 7 passenger for its comfort and versatility when the grandkids visit. We thought the inline 6 cyl would get decent gas mileage, at least better than the Explorer we had. Wrong! In town we are only getting 12-13 mpg as opposed to advertised 18. Highway 22 mpg about what expected. The 6 cyl is significantly underpowered - having to downshift constantly. Also the car has the most unintuitive controls, i.e., washer/wipers, door locks, headlight controls I've ever seen! Must be Swedish logic! It is a comfortable ride however for a mid-sized SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The part of my long commute that I simply love is the time I have to bond with my XC90. The power she has is awesome; the V8 is an absolute pleasure and provides the power that makes the XC90 actually feel like a sport car. The handling is so deceiving you forget you are driving an SUV. I have also witnessed Volvo being very attuned to improving this XC90 model over the years and I could not resist giving up my S80 for this XC90 as I have kept my eyes on the XC90 for the last 5 years. The fuel mileage is acceptable at around 20 mpg with a Tornado fuel saver installed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>(1) Technology/Design (Scandinavian simple approach!) (2) Power of new Yamaha based V8 (more power, more reliability!)

<TEXT>Just bought the XC90. Last car was the Acura MDX. Really enjoying the Volvo but do miss some of the nooks and crannies of the MDX for eye glasses, cell phones, loose change etc. Would also say the Acura had more of a luxurious feel on the inside. But, putting those things aside, the Volvo drives like a dream, definitely a tighter ride and handles better than the MDX and the interior is still very very nice. </TEXT>

I'm not sure what a previous poster meant about not having auto locking and a compass. I have both. The auto lock is turned off from the factory, you just turn it on as per page 108 of the manual. The compass is on my rear view mirror. Test this one before you buy anything.</TEXT>

And, it does so perfectly with its capacity for 7 passengers, plush and comfortable interior, all wheel drive, built in booster seat (gotta love it), safety features that Volvo is known for, decent mpg, and first class looks for a night out on the town.

Love the two-tone sport seats, suspension, Yamaha built V-8, Sirius satellite radio, etc. Surprised that at $ 51,145 list that there's no compass as standard equipment and no auto locking of the doors when the vehicle is in gear. I think the Ford bean counters are beginning to have an effect on Volvo.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having driven most of the SUVs on the market, the Volvo XC90 combines safety and comfort with ease of operation and a car like ride. Not only does it's design allow for a roomy passenger and cargo compartment but as far as occupant safety there is no comparison with other SUVs on the market today. The vehicle is built on the large sedan platform so it gives you all the advantages of an SUV with the ride of a luxury sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the car for my Wife. We have 3 Children 7 and Under. Had Minivan. Its my wifes car but I no longer dread driving her car. She chose the sport model which didn't break my heart. Love the susp and wheels. Great ride, tons of fun to drive, handles better than my maxima, looks awesome(red). Love safety features(essentially why I suggested to her). Downside is that it is not minivan which had tons of space, convenience for ingress and egress(obviously plus and minuses). Thankfully she was ready for an SUV again. Gas mileage fairly good, 18 mpg with the V8. Love features, loaded with all but nav. Seats are super, feel connected good ergonomics</TEXT>

Less expensive, better safety rating, better 3rd row seat configuration than Lexus; better interior features/finish and seemed more solid vehicle than MDX. We have put 7100 miles on it in about 3 months and have really, really enjoyed it. In- line 6-cylinder engine has plenty of power and fuel economy has been 22 mpg highway and about 18 mpg in town. This is very good considering the weight of the vehicle and the performance it has on the road, acceleration, etc. Also has great cargo room with the 2nd and 3rd row seats folded down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased a 2007 Volvo XC90 3.2. I was thinking about the V8 however I wanted better fuel economy. I was concerned that I would be sacrificing power (fun) for fuel economy. I didn't, this true SUV has power and is fun to drive. I know the V8 has more power but it is not necessary. I considered a Land Rover LR3. However I selected the XC90 based on the safety features as well as the ride. It is far superior to the LR3. If you need an SUV for getting around town and you want a comfortable ride for road trips then this is your automobile. It is also excellent in the snow so you can get to the mountains to do some skiing. I love it! Must have - Sirius satellite radio and running boards.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats, Satellite radio, fuel economy (ave 21 mpg), safety features (second to NONE), fun to drive, third row, integrated booster seats, wheels </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The comfort of the vehicle is exceptional for an SUV. The performance and handling feel like a sports car. Safety has always been a priority with Volvo and I find it is with their SUV as well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 speed transmission with the V8 makes a nice performance combination.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is solid and feels very safe. It's interior is classy, substantial. I have ridden in other, so-called more "luxurious" SUVs and find that they seem cheaply made, and plastic compared to the Volvo. On the freeway, I feel that I can hold my own in this very solid vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is so beautiful, as is the exterior. The car is classic and even though I had no intention of buying an SUV, I fell in love with it when I drove it. I had always thought it was the best looking SUV on the road. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I Love my Volvo! To own a Volvo had always been my dream, and finally came true! I got my Volvo for my birthday! I am so happy driving my XC90, with 7 seats has room for everything and everyone, it is beautiful, is eye catching! I feel so safe when I am on the freeway, it takes the curves so easy, and it feels so smoth!...I love every single detail of the vehicle, but what I love the most is that it is so roomy in the inside, without being to big in the outside. In SF is not easy to find parking, and I always wanted a vehicle, that will be easy to park, but that will be big enough to carry my whole family and pet, and also that will be elegant and safe...I sure found all that in my Volvo!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded a 2001 BMW X5 that I thought was the best until I test drove the Volvo. So far, getting about 20 mpg with the V8...much better than I got with the 3.0 in the BMW. Handles as well as the BMW since Volvo re-tuned the suspension in '07. Great ride. The Dynaudio stereo with the Sirius is awesome.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Xenon headlights that turn with the steering and the comfortable seating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A very easy car to drive, switched from a small sports-sedan without any problems... Superb interior quality. The controls are well designed and are easy to use. Feels safe inside. The new I6 3.2 engine performs well for a car of this size. Do not expect an X5 performance out of this car but the engine feels just right for this type of vehicle. Can?t wait to take it for another drive. Overall I am very happy with the purchase. I needed a family car that would be fun to drive and at the same time accommodate 4 adults and 2 small children. I think I made the right choice. The other vehicle I looked at was 06?MDX, which is a very solid SUV but it just did not feel like a $40K SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sedan-like performance. Comfortable seats. Great ride quality. Just the right size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After I ordered an '07 3.2, I spent a week in Germany driving a '07 V8 at high speeds. I was afraid the 3.2 might be a let-down, but it has not been. The six is completely adequate; quick enough off the line and the passing lane. Shift points match the engine well at all speeds. The XC90 is nimble for a two ton vehicle. Very comfortable seats, well designed interior, quality materials throughout. A very satisfying purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a new XC90 with the 3.2l I-6 engine. I couldn't be happier after 6 weeks of ownership. Quality, fit and workmanship appears to be great. Gas mileage has been decent (avg 20 mpg in mixed driving). This is my second Volvo (I also have a V70 T5) and I am very satisfied with the experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a loyal Volvo customer (3 Cross Country's) for almost 10 years and did not feel comfortable driving SUVs. After test driving the 2007 XC90 and enjoying the drive I was hooked. I am very happy with this car as it has more space than our family of four needs and it comfortably can take three of my children's friends. If you are looking for an SUV with good gas mileage 19 MPG, all the safety and luxury features you will ever need, this is the car for you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety, plenty of room, great convenience features (park assistance, homelink) and handles very nicely.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently bought an 2007 Volvo XC90 with the 3.2 6 cylinder motor. I do not like the sluggishness of taking off from a stop sign, light, etc. It seems also to handle like a bus, and not a sport utility vehicle.</TEXT>
