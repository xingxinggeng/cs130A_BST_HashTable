<TEXT>This is actually my wife's car. I drive it about once or twice a week. The car now has 55K miles and the problems, or complaints that I want to mention are the lack of power when the AC is on, and the knocking that comes from the steering column linkage. The power is expected because it's a 4 cylinder. The linkage problem is a flaw that has received a technical notice, but no recall. Very frustrating that Toyota won't recall this and fix a potentially dangerous problem. Otherwise, a very good car and excellent for your wife to use for work or kid hauling. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I experienced a windshield tick soon as I purchased the vehicle. Toyota service attempted a fix and it got worse. The tick was intermittent and after several trips to the dealer, and test drives, the dealer resealed the windscreen. The problem resurfaced recently. The dealers are unable to diagnose and fix it. My 36,000 mile warranty is expiring. There is also a rattle around the dash on the passenger side. Toyota is unable to diagnose that problem as well. I occasionally hear other noises and vibrations as well in the interior from the sun roof area and around the passenger door. Toyota replaced defective sun visors, and the glove compartments. The radio display mysteriously would go blank.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We got our RAV4 in 7/2007 and since then we haven't have any problem at all. There are two areas where the 2007 design failed: 1) The rear bumper upper part is too exposed to scratches during loading/unloading. 3) At winter ice forms between the spare tire and the rear bumper. That ice eventually tends to damage the rear bumper. 2) the spare tire cover was removed during a car wash and totally ruined. Someone mentioned that TOYOTA said only they know of one case... that is simply not true, it is pretty common and a big design flaw. After 2007 they changed the design of the car cover.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Rav4 problem is that the engine(6cyl) starts to whine at 40mph and continues at higher speeds although it is somewhat less obvious due to wind and road noise. I have never seen a review where an owner is concerned about this problem. Dealer says no technical notes from Toyota. Looks like we dump the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this new in 2007. It has 36,000 on it now. At 26K had to replace all 4 tires. They are 17" tires ($$$) and the dealer wanted us to pay 800 dollars to get it inspected. I bought them at a tire place for half. They said it was normal on Rav 4's that the stock tire wears out by 25K miles. The 30K maintenance cost us almost 400 dollars and I'm not really sure why. I get carsick in it if I'm not driving, same thing with my wife. My kid gets carsick on long trips as well. At 36,000 miles the check engine light came on accompanied by a light that said VSC and the 4X4 light too. Took it in and had to replace the coil. Paid 109 dollars for diagnosis. Also hard to tell if 4WD is on or not.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming soon to a recall near you: the external VVTi rubber hose of the 3.5L engine fails spraying quarts of oil all throughout the engine compartment. This is a very common problem in Toyota's 3.5L lineup and potentially affects Avalon, Camry, and Rav4. Engine seizures are a possibility. Toyota has redesigned this rubber hose as a steel hose for 2009 models but hasn't done much of anything for current 2006, 2007, and 2008 owners. This line broke at 45,000 miles for me. For other owners, it broke outside of the power train warranty. Many Rav4s have needed short block replacement due to this defect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This SUV is nimble and quick. It is still fun to drive after 2 years and 30K miles! The gas mileage - even for the V6 - is great, usually 22-23 mpg in mixed driving and 27-28 hwy. Acceleration literally blows anything else off the road and almost stops on a dime. It handles like it's on tracks. I have not had any mechanical issues with the vehicle. The one thing it needs, however, is a mounting bracket for the front license plate. In a 2- plate state like this one, that can be a problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned many Toyota (4Runner, Camry) - this is the third one and the last one - quality control has been an issue for my Rav4. There were quite a lot squeeze noise on the plastic part in the interior even when it's brand new. Spent some time to fix them. Now second year - the vehicle won't be able to start every 5 to 7 days. It's not battery for sure. It could be security system, starter, spark -- dealers (yes, I tried two Toyota dealers) won't fix it because they can't duplicate the error so they can't fix it. Oh, by the way, the audio system display started to not show anything, or strange Japanese characters. If you press the panel really hard - it fixes the problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just like the post from Deb on 05/05/2009, last month my 2007 Toyota rav 4 with v6 and 38,000 kms had its vvt hose break spraying oil in engine compartment but no engine light came on. Caused engine failure. Had to replace the engine - wasn't easy but they did it under warranty after pushing them hard. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I used to love this car. I ordered it specifically. We own several Toyotas. After only 37000 miles I had a VVT hose leak spraying the car engine and making loud grinding sound. The dealer will not examine the valves or open the drip pan. I have found this is more common than Toyota is letting on. Toyota has only replaced the hose (60000 power train warranty) and will not agree to look for any damage that may have occurred. The warning light does not come on until the oil is gone and the engine is frozen. Horrible combination. Hope this helps someone else avoid this situation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed more room than my 4 door sedan provided, but I didn't want a large gas sucking SUV. The RAV4 is perfect for my family's needs (we already have a minivan). The ride is very nice, reasonably quiet, and it holds the road well. The power of the 3.5 liter V6 is great, and I've been averaging 23.5 mpg in mixed driving over the 3000 miles I've driven the car. It seems to get between 25 and 28 mpg on the highway and between 17 and 19 around town. The third seat fits our 5 year old well, and since it's a 50-50 split, the dog can sit next to him in the back while the 2-year-old twins are quite happy in the middle row. Highly recommend! Great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's one the fastest SUVs you can buy, it can go 0-60 in under 7 seconds. It is also a great example why horsepower isn't everything. You hit the gas pedal on your RAV4. Front wheels start to spin. Traction control light comes up. The entire vehicle leans backwards. Finally it lunges ahead, shaking and ignoring the steering wheel input. There's a lot of passing power, but the vehicle is not designed for high-speed turns and does not feel confident above 80-85 mph. If you're interested in RAV4 V6 because of its power, Sport edition 4WD might be a better choice. There's no cure for high center of gravity, but stiffer suspension and proper drivetrain should help a bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I highly recommend this vehicle. I purchased the V6 Limited 4WD with leather, all accessories. Competition was the Honda CR-V which was, finally, no competition. Toyota V6 engine is effortless and power is remarkable. 5-speed transmission is smooth, quiet, unobtrusive. Transmission does not hunt. With V6 engine there is some torque steer, not much compared to other 270 HP engines. Interior is quiet; leather stitching is precise; beware: rear door is very heavy. HVAC is excellent. Real world MPG: first few tanksful of gas, 24.0, 24.6, 23.2 and 26.1. Conditions: Fresno, 95 to 106 degree heat, air conditioning, some freeway, some street. Be very judicious with throttle. 4wheel discs excellent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power. Same V6 engine as Lexus but with regular gasoline. Hint: treat throttle gingerly. You will be rewarded. Incredible lock-to-lock turning radius. Easy parking. Excellent HVAC. Big interior room. Extensions in visors: good. Locking gas cap. V6 MPG!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We took delivery two days ago, and we just completed our new vehicle's first road trip. After 400 miles in all types of driving, I am happy to report that our new RAV4 meets or exceeds every expectation that we had. I've seen several reviews that cited poor front seat comfort, but after two and a half hours each way in the driver's seat I didn't feel the slightest bit of fatigue. The front seats could stand to slide back another inch or so, and they maybe could use more side bolstering on the seatbacks, but overall they are very comfortable. Fuel economy for the first tank came in at 24 mpg, which I find spectacular in light of the available power. In short, it's a great ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased this vehicle last month, and so far I'm really enjoying it. I previously had a Honda CR-V, but was unable to buy another one because we are stationed in Germany, and they don't get CR-Vs at the American dealerships here. I settled for the RAV4, but so far I like it a lot. It's a little bit bigger than my CR-V, but not so big that I have trouble parking it or navigating down narrow streets. We got the third-row seat option, which I think will come in handy when we start a family or have guests! Not too noisy when driving 80+ mph down the Autobahn! One thing I don't like is a very large blind spot on driver side between windshield and driver door.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my sport edition in Feb. and have never been happier with a new car purchase. I wasn't going to get the 6 cyl. but am glad I did as I really like the power for freeway driving. It has a lot of room and is really comfortable for road trips. I was looking to buy the Honda CR-V but as I couldn't get the one I wanted, I am totally glad I ended up with the RAV4. I love the Bluetooth feature also which the Honda doesn't offer. I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the RAV4!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my car for over a year now. Overall, I like it a lot. I had to have an SUV, but it is just too large for me. Anyhow, I love the pick up and speed. It is excellent in the rain - absolutely sticks to the ground! Also, very good in snow, unless you try and go through the UP of MI - forget it - it felt like the car went into rear wheel drive mode. Scary, but for every day IL driving with some snow, it is fine. I hate the amber lights. With sunglasses on, I cannot read the console. I will never get a car with amber lights again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I really enjoy my 2007 RAV4. The ride is extremely smooth with a car-like feel. The exterior gives a sleek, handsome look which makes the RAV4 look like a real SUV (unlike, say, the Honda CR-V or Nissan Murano). 4-cyl engine has enough power to get me going on the freeway, yet it is quiet enough at high speeds where I can have a quiet conversation. Gas mileage is outstanding - I'm averaging 25-26 mpg with mixed driving (roughly 28-30 on the highway). All around, for the look, performance, handling and cost, I cannot imagine a better mid-sized SUV on the market today.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is great to look at, but the ride is very truck-ish. I used to drive a 1999 Sienna mini-van, which I loved. I thought this would be just as good. This car has more road noise and the seats are way to firm. The backseats are right next to the rear wheelwell and quite noisy on a rainy day. This vehicle could use some "plushness". I have had this car for 6 months and am trading it in for a 2007 Sienna (not financially prudent). The interior of my mom's 2004 Highlander is much nicer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't get me wrong I love my Rav. I went from a nissan to this and it is a definite step up. The gas mileage isn't as high as the sticker said. There is a need for mud guards or you will have chips on the sides. I wanted a dark interior so had to "settle" for the sport model but really wanted the limited. But TOYOTA is still number 1 in my book. We had an '89 toyota pick up and I loved it. It is still on the road and going strong. My cousin has it now - not a family vehicle after the kids got taller. I bought the extended warranty so I am good for 10 years bumper to bumper and I know the Rav will hold up for those 10 years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you want a reasonably priced SUV that has a LOT of power and versatility, look at this one. Some people may find the ride a bit rough. Unless you are shelling out BIG bucks for variable suspension, there is a compromise between the responsiveness of a stiffer suspension, and a smoother, "I can't feel the road" ride. It's all about what you like. The Limited IS highly responsive, but also has a reasonably smooth ride. The interior quality is good (I didn't say great!) and in-line with the price. The rear seats can be moved forward or back, accommodating large passengers or more cargo. It's a mid-sized SUV that offers some interesting features for a reasonable cost. Go for the 6cyl version!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Now at about 5000 miles, it has broken in nicely. To date best highway mileage is 27 MPG, mixed driving hasn't dropped below 23-24 MPG. I posted a review in 12/06, many of those first impressions are still alive. General observations: it works, but HVAC is slow to heat, the AC works fine. There is an occasional hum from the engine compartment when cruising at 50-55 MPH. The radio works well, but bass is not delivered too clearly (mid-radio option). Switchgear is refined, high quality. Steering is well weighted, but electric-motor-assist removes some steering "feel". Suspension is well tuned. Vehicle doesn't drift in crosswinds. Huge cargo space. Highly recommend.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall, my opinion has improved. The engine - beware, heavy feet mean a lot less MPG, still impressive MPG regardless (considering performance). Quiet at all speeds, including fast highway jaunts. Amazing crosswind resistance, it does not stray from lane easily at all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been driving a Toyota Avalon, the flagship of the Toyota line for several years. I needed a vehicle with more "utility" value. I researched the RAV4 on Edmunds as well as Consumer Reports websites. After an extensive test drive I purchased the RAV4. I am still pleasantly surprised and delighted every time I drive this larger and more powerful RAV4.

<TEXT>Everything about this vehicle fits me. I have had all brand-new vehicles in the past. I have owned a 97 Chev Cavalier (too little and poor quality sold it after 32k miles), then moved to a 99 GrandPrix GTP (loved it and sold it at 130k miles), then I bought a 05 Acura RSX (excellent quality, still that sporty feel that I like but with better gas mileage then the GrandPrix, engine was sorta weak however), Although I was not in need of a new vehicle I decided that I needed a small SUV (something I could grow with). I wanted to be able to carry camping gear, my bike and a few friends and be comfortable. I frowned at the thought of buying into something under powered and lacked the sporty feel.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet ride, 269 hp, sporty ride, 4wd, tows 3500 lbs, std 18" wheels, base stereo sounds great, convenient little features everywhere (heated mirrors, iPod connection, remote rear folding seats, full sized spare tire, plenty of cup holders, reclining rear seats, hidden storage), fun to drive!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The RAV4 Limited V6 rides well, has good power, and in most ways is a great SUV. But the front seats are AWFUL. Very, very uncomfortable for both my wife and me (5'3" and 6'). Very disappointing. Previously has a CRV and the seats were comfortable for short and long trips. Great SUV but I don't know how long we can keep it since we drive 20k+ miles per year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Replaced a 2000 Subaru Forester S 5MT with this vehicle for me to drive to work for 2 years and hand off to college bound child. It is very safe, secure and surprisingly fun and agile. Went with 2.4L engine for better mileage and to prevent my teenager (and me) from excessive speeding. Huge cargo area, especially without 3rd row can hold all my sporting gear. Very smooth and quiet engine and cabin. Sunroof does not take up headroom. Back seat room terrific compared to Forester and averaging same MPG (25) but now with automatic, much larger vehicle, more features and more comfortable ride with same nimble and sporty ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I had been test driving cars for months. The entire time I was shying away from Toyota becase of thier vanilla reputation. You know reliable but kind of bland. Once I drove the V6 4wd sport, WOW! I count myself as one of the converted. You can feel each and every one of the 269 horses. The suspension on the sport model is stiff and sporty but comfortable. Fit and finish is very solid. We drove the competition, Mazda CX-7 and Honda CR-V. I liked both but neither combined the functionality and fun factor better than the RAV4. Now that I have now driven this vehicle in varying Wisconsin weather conditions and I havent driven anything more stable in poor road conditions either. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Been a Honda dude for the past 12 years, but I traded my Odyssey in on the Rav4 mainly for an increase in MPG. We drive around 36000 miles per year and the hope of 30 MPG sounded great. We averaged 20 MPG in the Odyssey and in the first 1500 miles we are averaging 25.5 mpg with the Rav4 in evenly mixed city/hwy driving. We test drove the Mitsubishi Outlander, Honda CR-V and Jeep Liberty, but the Rav4 beat them all. The Outlander was our second choice, a close second choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All I hoped it would be, except for quality of interior materials - hard plastic looks cheap. Leather does too, but it isn't a Lexus; you can't have it all without paying for it. But, oh, the acceleration! Add a K&N air filter and it's even better. Mileage is great, and on 87 O to boot. Considered and drove the RDX, but that thirsty turbo 4 using premium just killed the deal. Too bad the MDX (the car we traded for the Rav4) was designed with the engine the RDX should have had. We have the optional pearl paint. Really looks great. The ride is better than our MDX had and this Rav4 is much more nimble.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't hesitate to pay the extra bucks to buy the V6. If you don't you'll wish you had. On automatics, make sure you put the automatic shift lever in D not 4th gear. When a driver pulls the lever into drive, the shift gate tends to lead you to 4th gear rather than D and I suspect drivers who get low mileage are doing this because the engine doesn't rev that high in 4. When we first got the RAV4, I drove many highway miles in gear 4 without realizing it and my mileage suffered badly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The V6 is blast, fast and responsive. MPG on first five tanks, 22.5, 23.5, 22.0, 23.0 and 24.5. The 24.5 was a full tank at 50-80 mph, the others where a mix of city and hwy. Interior is roomy, well put together, and very comfortable. Heated leather seats are very nice, moonroof, 9 spkr JBL, bluetooth, mp3, all add to the very nice driving experience. Although the brakes are competent, they feel soft when braking from high speeds. Not enough to worry about them working or not. If you test drive one of these, open the two rear passenger windows at freeway speeds. It gets loud, a reason why you should consider getting the moonroof as I did. All in all, well worth the money spent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched the 2007 RAV4, the Honda CR-V, and the Mazda CX7 before selecting the RAV4. The ride is very comfortable. Steering is precise and effortless, although being FWD, there's always a slight tendency for oversteer. Still, it's far less than the 2002 Mazda Tribute it replaced. Wind/road noise is nicely muted, even with the sunroof in tilt-up mode. Fully open, and with no deflector, it's still not so loud as to bother me. The controls and gauges are easy to reach and see. The daytime running lights...a $40 option...are a joy. Fit and finish are generally very good to excellent; nothing feels "cheap". I got a "Champagne" colored vehicle with the ersatz wood grain trim; it looks great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Visibility, driving position, and ride. This SUV is just a great drive for my daily 60+ mile commute. So far, I'm getting 27-28 mpg with 89 octane fuel. Some have declared the sound system as a weak point; I disagree. The unit keeps separate volume and audio setings for each mode...a great feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased in August '06, and have driven it about 5000 miles. Although the engine is powerful, there is a bit of steering instability when accelerating hard. Also, the suspension is a bit 'bouncy'. I also drive a Mini Cooper with very stiff suspension, and I guess I prefer the stiffer ride to the RAV4's. I agree that the standard stereo is disappointing, as are the cupholders. We get pretty good mileage (average 23mpg), but we tend to drive conservatively. It is tempting to step into the gas pedal now and then, but I am sure that this results in significantly less mileage, as others have reported. Also, when you do step into it, the downshift is rather abrupt and startling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you're considering the RAV4 for it's great milage, consider this... I travel 60 hwy miles, and another 20 on rural roads daily. My ave hwy speed is 72, and I'm no leadfoot around town, either. With this mix, I should be getting 25MPG consistently. After 4000 miles traveling the same daily route, my RAV4 averages 21.5MPG. One tank gets 19, the next, 23, and the next 21.5. Dealer says there's nothing wrong. So, if you're considering sacreficing the roominess and comfort of a larger SUV to get better milage with a RAV, think twice.</TEXT>

Although these two vehicles are in different classes, the RAV4 is just as quick and fast as the A3, but offers more room for cargo and passengers. You can't beat the room that the RAV offers and you certainly can't beat the price. Although I do miss the heated seats on the A3, I don't miss anything else. </TEXT>

I get about 300 miles per tank, about 50 miles less per tank than the 2 year old ford explorer I traded in on (sure the Explorer had a bigger tank but still. All told, I'd wish I kept the Explorer. I bought the RAV4 based on the 22/28 mileage statement which is just wrong - very wrong. I feel cheated.

In order to get the milage that Toyota says... you can't "gun it" at every light and you can't speed!! I promis you on this. I love the car. If you ride mountain bikes... it's perfect. The levers on both sides make the rear seats go down in no time. Don't get the 4cyl. It was quite a bit louder than the 6. Spend the money to get the 6.

<TEXT>This review written after 10,000 miles and almost 1 year ownership: We have a 17-year old so the goal was to find a small SUV which offered all modern safety features in a reliable package. Naturally Toyota & Honda were the top 2 choices and Honda had not yet come out with the new CRV in Feb 2006. We chose the 4-cylinder to avoid overpowering the car and are happy with it. Also avoided the optional 3rd seat to limit temptation to carry too many passengers. Visibility is good for the driver, the mileage is genuinely 26 mpg on highway at 65, and overall a year later still seems like best choice at time, but now that Honda has released new CRV I would recommend testing that as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was heavily influenced by the favorate reviews. After purchasing I was dispointed for two major reasons. The car looks fine when stands alone but appears so tiny when parked next to most other vehicles. Gas mileage is more like 20 rather than 28 even with 95% high way driving. That was one major reason I bought this vehicle. I would go exchange for something else if there were such a thing as exchanging a new car, like what you do in a supermarket.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The four-cylinder engine, which I tested in a RAV4 Sport, is pretty peppy, but the V6 boasts about a hundred extra horses, for an eat-my-dust total of 269. That six-cylinder is a sinful delight, as it turn the RAV4 into a veritable pocket rocket by pushing it from zero to 60 in under seven seconds. Driving the RAV4 is a pleasure. The view is excellent. Steering is precise and responsive, and the brake seems to read your mind. Cabin noise, even at 75-plus mph, is well under control. All the gauges and knobs are pretty much where you?d expect to find them. The cargo space is impressive ? bigger than that of a Jeep Grand Cherokee.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Even with two child seats, an adult can still sit in the middle of the backseat without getting badly squished. There?s even a ceiling-mounted three- point shoulder belt for the middle rear position, instead of just a lap belt. Thoughtful. Advanced safety features abound.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle (Sport 4WD 3.5 V6) has been nothing less than a pleasure to drive. Everything about it is excellent - From ride to handling and from comfort to style. My fiancee and I researched and test drove many SUVs for six months before making a decision. Absolutely no buyer's remorse. The flint mica is a beautiful color that is breath taking before sunset.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First day impressions (07 RAV4, 3.5L, AWD Sport): This is an excellent vehicle. Tight as a drum build quality, straight forward controls. Very intuitive. V6 performance is amazing. The transmission likes to down-shift to get moving in a hurry (sometimes it's too eager). Mixed driving averaging 22-mpg (based on first 100 miles). Even with the AWD model, some torque steer is noticable under hard acceleration, the engine is a free rev gem. Steering is precise, well weighted. Middle-end sound system is very good (6CD/MP3/Aux). Gauges are very easy to read. Accessibility for drivers/pass/trunk area is excellent. Seat comfort is very good, not quite a "10". Will submit a longer-term review soon. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, good visibility, excellent suspension response. Exterior design is elegant but strong. Interior is quiet at all speeds. Impressive mixed MPG for a new V6. All the controls move with a well weighted and tight feel. Doors open and close with a solid muted high-quality "thunk".</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my new RAV4. It is a kick to drive, has lots of room for my groceries, chicken feed and dogs. My only complaint is the gas mileage. I am not getting anywhere close to 27 mpg, and if anyone should, it's me. I live in a very rural area and do not do any "stop and go" driving." For a matter of fact, every tank so far has gotten worse. I started at almost 27 mpg and when I filled up today only got 22mpg. My first oil change is about 60 days away so I am hoping that the dealer can make some adjustments that will help. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the 4 cylinder version in January 2006. No complaints on motor. Interior is very spacious for this class. Two weaknesses stand out: 1) the interior rattles from more than one location, and I can't locate or stop all the rattles. Not good for a Toyota, frankly. 2) Less importantly, the center-console cupholders are very poorly designed. Prepare for spilled drinks because the pressure-tabs are useless for holding anything less than jumbo cups. Overall the vehicle is well worth the price. I like the 4 cylinder version (with no 3rd seat) for teenage drivers for safety considerations, and the rear-door spare too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With two kids, we love the optional third-row of seats. It allows us to take an extra kid or two to hockey practice, soccer..etc. There is a surprising amount of room left for storage with the third seat up. Though I wouldn't reccomend that row for anyone but children, because it leaves no leg room. With the seat down, there is a lot of storage in the back. Again, we are hockey parents, so that is a huge plus. The milage has been great, about 27 mpg, mostly highway driving. And I love, the audio jack for the MP3 player. The stability control is great, and it has downhill assist, which should come in handy in the snow this winter. </TEXT>

Flint Mica colour and black interior is HOT!! Have not accelerated hard yet so torque steer not evident. Handling in snow was accurate and precise. Visibility excellent even with wheel on rear door.

<TEXT>It's a rare and wonderful thing to find a small SUV being "over-engined", but this thing fits the bill. And to pay almost no penalty at the gas pump is icing on the cake. It has a few quirks, but every dip into that lovely V6 and 5 speed automatic manages to temporarily erase them. The most annoying thing so far was the typical current Toyota trend of having no choice of options: ALL V6 Sport AWD models in our 4 state area come optioned exactly the same way...Period. Other than that, the car has excellent chassis dynamics, a truly superior drivetrain, good highway stability, and it's fairly quiet to boot. Almost perfect for it's intended market. Front seat travel sacrificed for rear room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Rav for about 2 months now. I purchased Sport V6- great handeling and one of the fastest vehicles toyota now makes. There is very little wind noise on the highway at any speed. The driving position is comfortable although the seats are on the firm side. Lots of interior storage and the rear door opens to a nice flat floor. The floor storage is great for smaller items although you would be surprised how much can be fit in there. My mpg is averaging 20 city and 26 hiway- excellent for 269 hp! The added weight of the V6 up front really helps with snow/ice traction also.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the Rav Sport V6 4x4 for 5 weeks and 4000 miles. This vehicle is fun to drive, fast, gas mileage within stated range and Impressive safety features. We added Leather and heated seats locally which gives the RAV a Lexus look for a Toyota price. Back seat has room for two adults with amazing back seat room. Seats are comfortable, ride is firm, the Limited may provide a softer ride with the 17 inch tires. We prefered the exterior and interior styling of the Sport over the Limited. I would have liked the Bluetooth JBL stereo system, power seats and the automatic air which are standard or common options on the Limited models.

<TEXT>Beware of intermediate steering shaft problem with not only Rav4s but apparently other Toyotas as well. Do your research before buying. My rav4 is not 3 years old and mostly highway mileage but over 36k. Told by Toyota servicing dealer that the intermediate steering should be replaced at a cost of $1600. There is a tsb "Toyota service bulletin" for this problem but apparently since I'm over the 36k mileage (even tho car is less than 3 years old), I'm on my own.

<TEXT>Toyota got it pretty much right with this little SUV. It has one of the best power trains ever put into a vehicle. We don't baby it, and at 76 mph we get an honest 26 mpg. Stunning. Good use of interior space with spare outside the car, but the cover for said spare does not like car washes: it is easily pried loose by spinning car washers, then falls off and gets scratched or damaged. Still hate Toyota's unwillingness to sell me cars the way I want them optioned. We had ZERO choice of options as sport models destined for our 5-state region all came equipped the same way. Toyota made a BIG mistake with the front seat geometry: They need more rear travel and the rear needs to be lower.</TEXT>

Back seat is cavernous and comfortable. Love the reclining seats. The full size spare allowed me to get off a mountain pass after ruining a tire on a rock hidden in the snow. Try doing that with a donut spare. Downhill assist is a lifesaver on snowy, steep grades. I don't like the lousy 4WD system. Above 25 mph you have 2WD. If you lose traction you are on your own, even though there is a 4WD system that could help you out. I also hate the Sport's ridiculous harsh ride. Get the Limited for the softer suspension</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought a RAV4 for the wife. The drive is smooth and very car-like. Steering is responsive and acceleration is surprisingly quick...going 80mph felt like 60mph. Seats are comfortable for an SUV, and the suspension can actually handle rough roads. 4WD is always on, w/ 4-Lo available on demand. Safety features include 8 airbags. As a lifelong GM/Ford guy, I am impressed with the quality and fit & finish of the RAV4. All the standard features make this vehicle one to consider when looking for a small-SUV. Overall, I think Toyota did their homework and pulled out the stops with the redesigned RAV4. But don't take my word for it, take a RAV4 out for a test drive for see for yourself.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Even though it has been a short period of time, but after having owned several sedans and mini-vans in the past few years, and having rented other SUVs ocassionally, I can say I am amazed about this car. It is easy and fun to drive, it has most of the features you would ever want, and it is very safe and stable to handle. Finally, visits to my dealer are also fantastic. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This little SUV is great fun to drive. It has tight handling, great turning radius, good ride, and the acceleration...whoa momma! Buy the V-6 and you will understand what I mean. We bought a Limited with all the bells and whistles, paid right at $1000 under MSRP, so we felt like we got a good deal. The interior roominess is close to that of much larger SUVs. Road noise is much quieter than the CR-V. I'll be curious to see if we get anything close to the mileage rating of 21/28. My only disappointment is that the Rav4 is my wife's vehicle, and I hardly ever get to drive it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I waited 5 months for a V6 Limited with factory leather to arrive at my dealer. I was about to give up, ask for my deposit back, and opt for an RDX or an X3. In addition to both vehicles being more expensive than the RAV4, I was concerned about gas mileage on the RDX and repair costs on the X3. The RAV4 was worth the wait. The vehicle is better than I expected. I got 25 mpg on my first tankful with combined city and highway driving, so it should get better from there. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit and finish quality is outstanding. The V6 engine is very smooth, makes this a very quick ride, and gets good gas mileage. The climate control system on the Limited is a big upgrade from the Base and Sport. Leather seats are very confortable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Rav4 means quality and performance. I urge you to test drive one that matches your personality. I can only talk about the more powerful V6 2WD version with 269 horses. Driving the Rav4 (V6 2WD) is like driving a rocket. I bought the V6 base and it is fast. The transmission is a little touchy but it really kicks into gear when needed. The list 0-60 time is 6.6. I have smoked many 30K sedans off the line. I can have fun and still have room for friends. If you want a fast, quality, functional ride you should look into getting one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Follow up to my 4/12/08 review. Hesitation when accelerating is a torque steer issue. The front wheel drive can't handle the massive horsepower. Changed oil and tried premium gas to no avail. This engine is meant for 4WD & not really for FWD. Changed my local driving habits for this vehicle, cannot punch it from a start or at slower speeds & step on it when it's moving faster. Edmunds has an article, "Long-Term Test: 2006 Toyota RAV4" that goes into detail about this acceleration issue with FWD. Wished it came out sooner. We'll probably spend a few more bucks & get into the luxury segment next time. One thing I do know, this engine is sound and should last for a very long time. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is actually getting better. No need for premium gas, handling is good, low maintenance, spacious for rear passengers. When the vehicle is sitting on idle, you can barely hear the engine running. It's a practical vehicle without spending big luxury SUV money.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My V6 RAV4 Sport 4WD has so much content and quality for a $25k SUV that one year later I'm still amazed at how Toyota did it. I live in the Mojave Desert and the optional "Tow Prep Package" w/bigger radiator & heavy duty alternator is a blessing. From all the many standard "Star Safety System" features - standard on ALL models - to the competence of the vehicle in many situations from the highway to rocky roads to snow to the speed (the V6 is a hot rod!) to the great mileage which, according to my ScanGauge II data center I installed, is right on at 27 mpg highway. This is still the best SUV for the money when power, mileage and quality are factored into the equation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 6 cyl is awesome and the handling is nice. But there is a lot of air noise and it is not a quiet ride. We now drive the sedan on long trips because of the interior noise. With gas at $4 a gallon, and going up, it may become too expensive to drive. I barely get 24 MPG on the interstate, driving 320 miles round trip, and barely 23 MPG, driving to work, and that's a 40 mile trip on the highway. My dealer told me, there is nothing he can do about the gas mileage if the check engine light is not "on". The ride is "OK" but not great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wife and I love the vehicle. To nit pick anyway: V6 offers fierce acceleration. Needing work... tranny has disconcerting habit of being "between gears" when braking to about 15 or 20 and then accelerating... races a bit before engaging proper gear. Pass gear engages too easily. No postings seen on this. May be adjustable by Toyota. Mildew smell from A/C vents at start up but dissipates quickly. Bit noisy at hwy speeds. White paint fairly fragile and nicks rather easily. Driving with one rear window down causes causes a 2 or 3 cycle "bup-bup- bup" pressure oscillation which is no fun on the ears. Don't push anything or front cap will crack. I still love the car and would buy another one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My second RAV4! I liked my 2003 RAV4, but was ready to upgrade from the standard model. I love my new 2007 RAV4. After much debating and shopping around, I felt this had more bang for the buck and better gas mileage. The V6/4WD makes a HUGE difference as far as handling. The dealer also told me about making sure you are in D for drive vs 4th and I have not had an issue with mileage (21-23/27-30 depending on ac usage) I have driven/owned other competing models over the years and felt they didn't and still don't measure up to the RAV4. Most small SUVs still had that gocart feel. This is a solid, dependable car. I also really like the darker nautical blue color that is not that common.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was a very generous gift from my parents for college graduation and although I would be happy with any car given to me, I am overall very pleased with this car. It's an SUV but doesn't necessarily drive like one. It accelerates fast and handles well around turns, it is not top-heavy like many SUVs. The storage is great! I've had that thing packed with 5 adults and enough luggage to where I've had to rely on my side mirrors to back-up, but everyone was comfortable and I heard no complaints, to my face that is. Fairly fuel-efficient for an SUV. Although if that's your priority, I would suggest a Ford Escape or Mercury Mariner. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back seats that move back, adjust and go down flat very easily. I've even put a full-size air mattress down and slept back there while camping last year and it was perfect! Extra hidden storage in the back. Sound system is pretty decent. Handles well with ice and snow. Sleek exterior design. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought it because of the 6 cyl. My Honda had 6. It got 20-21 mpg in city. Only getting 17. Have transmission difficulties that dealer says don't exist. Have filed with NTSA. Have to drive like stick shift mode (it's an automatic) just to get it to drive/shift in a normal pattern. It either bogs down/lags or takes off. There is no happy medium. Would be happier with manual transmission at this point. I shopped for almost 2 years, made my decision and am not happy. </TEXT>

Drove from NoVa to NC beaches (10 hours) with 4 adults, 2 dogs, luggage, boogie boards, beach chairs, etc., plenty of room, everyone comfy the whole trip. Temp over 100 degrees, had no problems with AC. I like the side-hinged rear door; when installing the cargo carrier on the roof rack, I was able to stand on the rear deck and install the back end of the carrier, also the carrier could stick out further than the back of the car and we could still open the rear door. This SUV is so much fun to drive, it handles beautifully, it's powerful, I still love driving it after almost 18 months. Only maintenance so far: oil changes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove from Chicago to Las Vegas (1700+) miles smoothly. Plenty of horses, but accelerating from a stop, the transmission tends to lag a bit. Not sure if it's torque steer, the SUV weight or needs better quality or premium gas, or the trans itself. However, once you get moving, this vehicle can fly. It rides very smooth on the highway even going 100+. It's a bit bumpy on local streets, especially for the rear passengers, but keep in mind, after all, it is an SUV. Exterior looks great, but the interior is a little "plasticky", I guess that's how you keep costs down. If you want more refinement, go with the luxury brands. Otherwise, this is what $25K gets you (w/o 4WD). Overall, good value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Strong and quiet engine. Great handling for a big vehicle as it hugged all the CO/UT/AZ twists and turns. Rear storage space, especially the hidden hatch where a spare tire would be.

<TEXT>I bought this SUV for my family last year (wife & 1 yr old son). The style played an important role in the decision. We took it in a few road trips and were very happy with the general performance. Nice handling, lots of power (even for a 4 cyl engine) great traction on snowy roads and good stereo system with iPod/MP3 capability. The cargo area is pretty generous with under floor storage. On the other side the throttle feels a little too sensitive, specially when taking off and the tranny tends to have a delayed reaction when slowing down and pulling into a driveway or parking lot (I am not sure but this could be an issue just with my car; I haven't had it checked yet).</TEXT>

<TEXT>The engine has sufficient power, at 270 hp. The vehicle seats 4 comfortably. The road and wind noise is excessive, especially on rough surfaces. The dash is made of cheap material. When the gas cap is opened the finish is dull and rusty. I am experiencing a tic-tic around the driver's sun visor area. The dealer says he does not hear it. It is intermittent but faint, and I hear it everytime I drive. There is also a light rattle sometimes when braking to a stop, again it is intermittent, my 96 Toyota camry v6 has 250,000 miles. I am the original owner and did not experience any of the defects and problems with the rav4. The Camry ride is a lot quieter. I am disappointed with the rav4 .</TEXT>

<TEXT>Before we started shopping, we had our choice narrowed down to the Rav or the Honda CR-v. After driving each of them, the choice was simple. The Rav was quieter on the highway, less road and wind noise. Takes bumps great, and we hit 70 mph in no time. This is for our daughter in college, so we chose the base model, figuring her friends would probably borrow it, and it would be parked in lots where nicks would be inevitable. If you don't need a moonroof and auto climate control, the base model is fine. She uses the iPod hookup most of the time, so didn't need the 6 disc changer. The radio on the base is plenty good, and still has 6 speakers. 4 cylinder seems to be peppy and very responsive.</TEXT>

The interior is extremely comfortable, the ride is smooth, there are no rattles or squeaks (even doing 75 on the highway), and even this 4-cyl. merges with traffic and gets up hills w/o problems. I like that the door swings out rather than up. At less than 5' tall, I can reach it! I like the fact that the door swings out to face the wrong side of the curb. I park in my driveway and the open part of the back faces my walkway to the house. Perfect.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth and radio controls on the steering whee.l Leather, power heated seats. Plenty of storage space. Nimble, good cornering, easy to handle. Doesn't ride or feel like a "truck". Spare tire on the back with cover helps to give the RAV a sporty look.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the first car for my wife and me. We looked long and hard at the Honda CRV, but kept coming back to the RAV4. The RAV had the 3rd row option and a V6 engine. We're extremely happy with our choice. The RAV4 is very responsive and very very fun to drive. The 3rd row could be bigger. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving my 2007 Toyota RAV4 for about 5 months. I love driving it. The 6 cylinder engine and 4WD are sporty and fun. It is incredibly easy to handle, park, etc. The driveability is like a sedan, but the SUV body type lifts the driver for better visibility. I can't compare the maintenence cost to other SUVs, as I've only previously owned cars. The interior of the 2007 limited edition RAV4 is very comfortable and loaded with options. The cargo area is huge and the fifth door makes loading it very easy. I love this car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my RAV in Febuary 07, and recently noticed a variation in the Barcelona Red Panels on the rear door surrounding the spare tire cover. Informed dealer, regional service manager and the Corporate Customer Center in CA. Noted that same problem was on a vehicle from GA, and conversed with other dealers regarding same, noting from them it is common on all RAVs to have discoloration thru out the rear door. Advised corporate of problem by both myself and the district service rep. stating that it was a manufacturing/paint problem not a servicable problem. Other than that, I get 25 mpg on country roads and only moan when going up a hill with the cruise trying to find the right gear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car after visiting the dealership 3 times. After test driving the Nissan Rogue, Honda CVR, Mazda3 & 2008 Highlander, I decided this was the best choice for me, my 1st Toyota! I've owned 3 Mazdas, 1 Nissan, 1 BMW, 1 MBZ, 1 Subaru (I know, I'm a car junkie!). I am also very impressed with Toyota's track record & the fact that my car is 100% Japanese. I have owned it all of 24 hrs and have no regrets. The gas mileage seems ok so far, the car is cute as a button. Drives with a touch of sport suspension. Seats are fine with me so far, no long distance drives yet. I am very happy with my purchase!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sporty suspension, black interior, rear door is cool to me, upgraded stereo rocks! Cup holders are sturdy, my kids dig the reclining rear seats! I need to hook up the Bluetooth and get a plug for my iPod. I love it all so far!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I sold my V6 99 Accord to help finance the 07 RAV4 and so far so good. It's as near perfect in terms of optioning as I could find, and the utility it offers is second to none. The interior layout is classic toyota and controls are placed in harmony where you'd want them to be. Outside styling is always personal, but I love looking at it even after the honeymoon period is over. Rear door is a blessing and a curse, but when picking up a plasma TV last week my mother's 06 Ford Escape could not hold it b/c of the rear liftgage setup. The RAV4's swing door allowed more vertical clearance. Also, love the spare on back to allow for more cargo space even at expense of the "look." </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Functionality of cabin and V6 of course. Fuel economy is better than most. FYI on towing package: I purchased with tow prep and it does not include any wiring for the trailer hitch and/or the hitch itself. Add $300-1000 after purchase to be ready to tow anything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Almost everything is as advertised about the base model 4WD 2007 RAV4 except for the front seat comfort and the spare tire cover. The front seat comfort is really horrible. If you value the lumbar area of your back, you will not get the standard seats. Do what you have to do to get better seats. Also, the stock spare tire cover is going to be impossible to get back on correctly. There is not enough room to get your fingers and hand around the sides of the spare tire. I'm looking for some kind of replacement cover. The manual says I'm supposed to have a cover with a latch, but all I have is a cover that has stretchy material around it. </TEXT>

We were seriously looking at the Honda CR-V also (I was replacing a Honda Accord which I loved) but frankly didn't think the interior CR-V features were up to speed with the RAV4. Only issue we have had is a problem with tire inflation on driver side. It keeps losing air for no apparent reason. This is a great vehicle for moving or purchase of large or awkward items which cannot easily fit in a car. Sure do love it!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this RAV after owning a 1998 RAV. So the difference is quite noticeable. This is my daily driver, so I needed 4WD and wanted good/decent gas mileage. The cabin is much larger, both with leg room and shoulder room. Love the look of the Sport (I think it handles tighter with the larger wheels). Gas is about 25 mpg with 80/20 highway/local driving. The road noise is considerably less. The back seat area is spacious, even if you're 6'2". The 4 cylinder has a nice punch, its not a 6 cyl, but off the line is good with just me in the car. When I test drove the sales guys said that the 6 is too much. Test drove CRV and 07 highlander-liked the RAV better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The V6 has power and makes the car fun to drive. It is great on the highway. But there is a lot of wind/road noise in this car. For a car of this price, I was surprised that there was so much road noise that it makes conversation difficult without raising voices and feeling like you are yelling. The driver's seat is uncomfortable during any longer drive. The seat should be more like an upgraded Camry seat instead of an ordinary budget seat. The passenger's seat seems to be more comfortable even without all the adjustments. It is a good urban car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Layout and design is the best out of all the other SUVs I have looked at. More leg room in rear than any other SUV. Overall it is just what I was looking for. Fuel mileage is acceptable and power is good for a 4 cylinder. Handling and ride are good along with attention to detail when building. If you buy this vehicle just don't plan on using cruise control if you get a 4 cylinder version. You will not be happy with the way it performs. Before you buy do a search for 06 and 07 RAV4 cruise control problems and you will see what I am talking about. Toyota dropped the ball on this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car for my wife. We wanted a safe, reliable vehicle. I believe we got one. We looked at all of the different competitors in this class and far and away liked the RAV4 best. This car has a lot of get-up-and-go! I wanted to get it before Toyota realized they gave this thing too much power. If you look at the power/weight ratio, it beats most everything but a ?Vette.

I got absolutely the most base setup I could, and I love the features.

<TEXT>Bought the Sport 3.5 liter V6 4wd in April and enjoyed my first 5000 miles. The six cylinder feels powerful and propels 4 people up steep hills and highway on ramps with astonishing acceleration. The sport tuned suspension provides a firm ride which minimizes body roll when you push it into the curves. Interior is comfortable for 4, a bit snug for 5 although rear leg room is plentiful for my 6 foot teenager. The front seat is comfortable for me - I am 5'10, with a cranky back. We recently went on family camping trip and with a roof carrier had no problem carrying everything. Only two beefs: the gas tank of 14 gallons is too small - 300 mi. before you get nervous, and the radio stinks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Frankly, I got fooled by my purchase. I realised after the purchase that I have bought a low end SUV even though it costs more. I used to own a camry and I thought that as Rav4 is little expensive it will be better comfort wise. But that is not true. It feels like you are driving Corolla. No power (4 cyl). Lot of external noise. Lot of shocks. So, basically it is not a smooth as Camry. I got a factory installed remote start which stinks.

It had all the bells and whistles, but fuel economy prevailed and I finally traded it in with 125,000 miles on it. The RAV is fun to drive and my big teenage boys say the back seat is roomier and more comfy than the Explorer. Love the MP3 hookup and the rear door doesn't bother me. I really wish the driver seat had more adjustment features. We are getting about 23 mpg. Not bad. Have to break it in more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed a four-wheel drive vehicle for the mountains. I've had not a single problem with this Rav4 2007 Basic. Seats fold in 60 sec to load it with firewood. It handles well on mountain snow. It does not die, or gear struggle, on steep roads, loaded with equipment and four passengers. Downhill, the steep-grade feature nicely paces the vehicle without your active acceleration. The Basic has standard features such as cruise control, vehicle stability control, traction control, 4WD on demand - superior features for the Catskill Mountains. It's a quality vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration is awesome. Folding the rear seats is simple, for a flat surface. Handling is confident. Rear seat room, especially, is great.

<TEXT>The Toyota RAV4 Sport V6 is a wonderful, well thought out vehicle. I looked at the other competitors before buying and they don't offer the interior features, room, and comfort that this vehicle does. The drive is comfortable and the V6 engine has great pick up with 269 hp. Also note that the V6 gets only one mile less in gas mileage compared to the four cylinder. The safety features built in along with available options for this vehicle are great. The height of this vehicle is also just right, and unlike the Honda CR-V four cylinder, there is more power and more interior room. You will get many compliments with a Toyota RAV4 Sport V6.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The first things that appealed to me were the styling and pricing for the Limited. At first glance, the interior looks well-designed and human-factored. It is overly plastic though, and that detracts greatly from the quality one would expect in a Toyota product. This RAV provides a great ride and good handling. At the bottom of the list of features, and this comes at a bad time, is gas mileage. I'm getting right at 20 mpg with a four cyl. engine around town. Six bangers can do much better than that!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The RAV4 has some noteworthy strengths, including the peppiness of the 4-cylinder engine. I like the outside appearance and the look of the tan and black interior is nice. However, the interior build quality is severely inadequate. It doesn?t look like the interior is going to hold up very well, especially considering its POOR suspension. If you hit a good sized bump, like a pothole or railroad crossing, prepare to cringe! It feels like the car is falling apart.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like that the car "beeps" when you lock/unlock it. I also like the radio controls on the steering wheel and the light above the center cup holders.

The fuel economy has been as advertised, if not better. However, I don't drive aggressively, and I followed the "first 1000 miles" recommendations. The first week of ownership, I was aware of slight road vibration under my feet (I was coming out of a luxury sedan) but I no longer notice it. I highly recommend the RAV4.</TEXT>
