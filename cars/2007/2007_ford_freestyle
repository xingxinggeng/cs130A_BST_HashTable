<TEXT>I bought a used 07 Sel FWD In April 09 with 21,000 miles. I can not find anything I do not like. This vehicle has great interior room,and the footprint is the the same as the 98 Taurus wagon with 150K miles on it that I retired. It is the easiest car I have ever changed oil on. The gas mileage is outstanding. 21/22 normal everyday driving. With 5 adults on the Interstate at 70 mph the computer indicated 28mpg. I did not believe that number and did my own calculation and the result was 27.The third row seat is fine as long as your not going too far. The front and second row seats are great. No mechanical problems , but I have not driven that many miles.Enough power for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am an avid Ford owner but am extremely disappointed to learn that at 54000 miles I am being told that yes they know there is a problem with the transmission (CVT) and they recognize the risk it poses to citizens but they are not willing to repair at their expense. I really don't want another car but cannot justify repairing this one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the style, versatility and handling of the vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Shame that ford went for funky techno styling in the Flex & Edge. As a more sophisticated individual- the Volvo styling they followed is classic. This car is way more capable than hauling with the seats down, It handles & corners well ; the low wide wheel.frame is great to manuver.Classic ford ride- heated seats, all power options. I saved tons over a used Volvo. And it is an extremely SAFE vehicle. good curb weight- NO roll or sway on bends.turns. awesome in all weather. Can't say enough- have had cadillac prior, SRX is an overpriced joke- except for the Bose stereo. It's a keeper. Ford should have put more advertising into THIS car. Their loss.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As an engineer I tend to research things to the last detail. I was looking for a family car that had a good combination of safety, fuel economy, roominess, luxury, and price value. After looking at everything made, the Freestyle won. We bought used, a 2007 Limited. The car is amazing; Titanium green w/tan leather interior...gorgeous... Lots of room for storage and very comfortable. The fuel economy on the highway is almost 30 miles per gallon...no kidding....the navagation system is wonderful and the back up sensors are very helpful, as is the DVD. After 6 months, no issues. My wife, who hates SUVs, loves the car and wont let me drive it....Its simply amazing.....Well Done Ford. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought in 1/2008 w/12k miles. I have only put 12k miles on it but I love it. Kids take it on long trips with friends and love it. Great hwy mileage. Short commute (and lead foot) keeps mpg quite low. Capital Ford/Raleigh just replaced front/rear brakes for free. I love them, too! When was the last time you said that about your dealer service? I have no complaints about the power. Performs well in NC mountains.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I bought this model to load dogs in and out - SO EZ! I love it. Older dog easily gets in/out with mid seat out of way. I call it my wagon on steroids. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I echo everyones comments here, but I have one piece of advice to up your fuel consumption. As I'm from the UK but live in the USA and we have gas selling at almost $8 a gallon we have to find ways of driving to save or stretch gas as far as we can. So, first off, get a light foot. Second, don't race to the next set of lights if they are red. Third, Don't excelerate from a stop to fast, be gentle with the pedal, back off once you reach the speed you want. Forth, When you have a good hill to go down, knock the thing in to neutral and coast, slot it back into drive when you need to. Fifth, try to drive without using the brakes to much, braking costs energy. Last, use cruise, always, everywhere</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>That self dimming mirror :-) And the heated seats in winter, Mmmmm :-) I love the trim as it is, understated and classic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car used with 5,000 miles in the fall of 2007. It has gone through two Buffalo Winters like a charm. The AWD is awesome in the snow and on wet road conditions. There is plenty of room for a family of six. We load the car often for family get a ways and drives like a champ. This is agreat alternative to minivans. Many adults compliment on the room and comfort of the back seats. The kids have plenty of room to claim their own kingdoms with enough closeness to make alliances and enough distance when diplopmatic relationships are on the brink of all out war! If you are in the market for a great family car, look no further. I would recommend this to any family.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The AWD in tough road conditions, the smooth transmission, the room in the third row, plenty of space all around. Great car to take on trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought it used with 23k on it. My wife & I have put a little over 1000 on it and we are very pleased! The mileage is unbelievable for a vehicle this size. Averages about 21.5mpg around town and on a recent trip got 30.8mpg running 55- 75 with mostly 65mph ranging from 5,000ft - 6,5000ft elevation. Rides very nice and everyone likes the layout and comfort. Visibility is good and I like the 6CD player.For the $15,000 we paid I would feel guilty expecting. anything more from it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I always wanted a Freestyle and found a real bargain in the local area. I've had the vehicle about 6 weeks. Brakes had been repaired before I bought it. Otherwise, the vehicle has been perfect. Wife's car, and I was a little skeptical as she traded a 2002 Lincoln Continental. It's not a Continental, but she loves the high seating and comfort the vehicle offers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Intuitive controls - easy to program and set. Peppier than I expected this vehicle to be: don't be put off by criticisms of the engine until you try it. Plenty of legroom front and back. I've always found the exterior design to be attractive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love this car. Practical, comfortable for 4, and practical for 6 (we have all buckets). We have kids to take to and from college and a couple of dogs, and this car always has the room we need. The fuel economy has been great. With careful driving, we average 23 MPG driving around the burbs and 26 on the highway. This car's mileage really goes up if you drive with a light foot. Comfortable and practical, this car is just what we wanted.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We got the leather option, and the seats are very comfortable in town or on the road. A sensible amount of engine power, great mileage. Back seats easy to manipulate. Handles well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got my Freestyle last year as a Christmas gift after my van was totaled. I absolutely love it. It is so comfortable and easy to get in and out of. I have 2 kids so the third row seat is a blessing. We can travel and the boys each have their own space. Every trip we have taken has been great. I have back and hip trouble and I haven't had to stop and stretch or take any breaks it is so comfy to ride in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previous review 21/1/07 - "Great car, so-so mileage on AWD". Almost one year later, still love this car at 29000 miles. Hugely comfortable. Noticing the climate control buttons take a little too much attention to operate (small buttons, big fingers). Would prefer some dials for mode selection. Had rear brakes replaced at 24K - common problem. That's the only problem though. Mileage has improved as I've learned how to drive it (i.e. - relax!). Getting 18 city and 24-27 on freeway, depending on speed (27 at 60, 24 at 70). Carry 6 people to lunch on regular basis. Trip from WA to CO was a huge success with lots of room and no driver fatigue. Still feels/smells new to me. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is awesome. Not a sports car but corners very flat. No body roll at all. Accelerates well enough when you put your foot in it, just makes some noise while doing it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had my Freestyle a week, but I am already in love. It gets great gas mileage and so user friendly. And it has all the bells and whistles. And seats 6 for hauling the kids and friends. And the CVT transmission is a true asset. This is Ford's best kept secret. I let my dad drive it and he swore he felt it shift. He still doesn't get it. Best thing ever spent my money on. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My fiancee wanted another Explorer, even though she had numerous mechanical problems with her previous Explorer. She was talked into buying the Freestyle, partly because of the CVT. The car is noisy, sluggish and cramped. The capper? The vaunted CVT failed after 50,000 miles. The price tag? $7,000. Ford disavows the possibility that it was a defect. Have you driven a Ford lately? Good Luck brother!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first long road trip we've taken with our new-(bought used), Ford Freestyle, automatic, 3.0 liter engine. We loaded the car with 6 adults, an 18 cubic foot cartop luggage carrier and filled the somewhat cramped luggage space in the back. This car worked flawless. A smooth, effortless ride up the mountain passes and well controlled ride with plenty of brake reserve on the downhill runs. The ride for all passengers was smooth and comfortable. When we did hit those few rough road conditions the car absorbed all but the deepest ruts and bumps. In heavy traffic we were able to accelerate, brake and move with ease in spite of our heavy load. A breeze to park and maneuver.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine. We averaged 20.5 mpg for the trip and we moved right along no matter what the terrain. Excellent disk brakes at all four wheels. Ride comfort, visibility, seating for 7, luggage rack, controls for rear heating, air, and ventilation. Easy to move in tight spaces. Backup warning indicator.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I found almost everything I wanted in a car in the Freestyle. The space, seating is perfect for family of 5 and dog. Heated seats are heavenly in the winter. Dual climate control and rear climate control is great. Gas mileage is pretty good for a larger vehicle. And I really needed the AWD, no more worries about getting home in the snow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, sleek interior, responds great, multi CD player and the dual climate and third row seats. I was glad to find out they didn't discontinue it. It should have been more widely advertised, it answered most if not all of my requirements.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded an 05 Freestyle w/ only 30,000 mi in order to get the CVT which was phased out in the Taurus X! Usually drive machine to 100,000 to 150,000 mi! An hr of expressway driving with the six spd AT after getting used to the small efficient 6 w/ CVT made me take the depreciation hit! My 07 has had no issues mechanically and the fit & finish is excellent! I enjoy getting away from the stoplites faster than most and no hunting for gears as the RPM's stay up and then come down to cruise. Very comfortable vehicle for 6 adults! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT with small V6 quite economical. Sound system excellent! Sunroof a pleasure.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car new and it now has 30,000 miles. It has been 100% trouble free and everything works like new. Other than oil changes and tire rotations, the car has not needed any repairs of adjustments. It gets great mileage, even better than on the EPA sticker. I get 21 to 22 MPG in town and 28 to 29 on trips. The car is extremely plesant to drive and is very comfortable, even for tall drivers. The fit and finish are superb, rivaling the Mercedes and Infinity cars I have owned before. The leather seats have very good lumbar support and adjust to very comfortable positions. It will haul large loads with the seats folded down and will pull my 16' boat with ease at 75 mph. A great car</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the comfortable interior and the smooth engine/transmission. The car has plenty of power and gets great fuel mileage for a fairly large vehicle. The car has been totally trouble free since new. I wish I could have said the same for the 5 Mercedes I owned that cost several times more.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the Ford About a year ago, traded a gas lovin 00 Durango for it. Pretty skeptical at first never bought a Ford before, but I tell you it's the best for room, looks, and CVT tranny for nice smooth acceleration. Third row seat is easy accessible for my kids. The AWD drive and traction control is very nice in snow and ice. All in All it's perfect for family of six, just can't take anyone else with us.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my Freestyle for just about a year. It has met my needs nicely- providing easy access and egress for my elderly mother with severe arthritis on our many errands to doctors and social functions. Cargo space very satisfactory for road trips and for the possible need to evacuate in advance of hurricanes. I've got the same or greater cargo capacity as I had in my Chevy Trailblazer but with more comfort for my aging mother and much better gas mileage. I also have better visibility in all directions with this vehicle. One thing I am not pleased with is the seemingly light weight construction of the ext. door panels. Very minor bumps in parking lots create very visible dimples.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Combined highway/city mileage averages between 24 and 25+ MPG for a very sizeable vehicle. Not hybrid numbers for sure, but better than many CUVs/SUVs. This car is criticized for it's "underpowered" V6, but with $4.25/gallon gasoline, I'm happy to sacrifice acceleration for better mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was a little concerned buying domestic over import - had been a Previa driver for years, but what an awesome replacement. This baby has power, comfort and hugs the road in all conditions, including our Canadian winters which are a mixed bag. Biggest test came during 'superstorm' last June. I hadn't realized how bad the road conditions were that night, but the Freestyle slogged through everything that storm threw at us and then some. (My Previa would never have made it - and we passed several others pulled off too.) Only thing that could be improved is my city gas mileage, but I love the power on the highway and when set to cruise, the highway mileage is great for that size engine!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth transmission, excellent acceleration. Driver's seat just hugs the body - like driving in a really comfy armchair. Great space in the interior; really simple mechanisms to take advantage of a variety of seating positions; never thought I'd use reverse sensors but they're handy too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just turned 49,900 miles on my 2007 Freestyle Limited AWD. This is the best 7 passenger vehicle AWD out there. It has been through mud, sand and snow and is unstoppable. Consistently gets 20-22 mpg in combined driving in New Jersey. Back and forth Florida to New Jersey a couple of times, and the vehicle is very easy to handle. Much better in crosswinds than any SUV and just as comfortable inside. The AWD drive system from Volvo in this thing is the best, and at a much lower price than a Volvo.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 3.0L 4 valve DOHC 6 cyl works well with the CVT. It always seems to be in the power band. Navigation system is easy to use. The heated seats are the best.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought a Freestyle limited June 2007 and almost a year later had to trade it in. From day one we had a constant gas smell. Took it in and half a tank of gas later could find no problem. Kept driving it and smell got worse. Mpg highway was around 18, City was 15 at best. Winter was terrible because it would get stuck in 1/2 inch of snow. We had the pebble leather and it reflected in the front window very badly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have put almost 15,000 miles on our Freestyle in less than a year. We just returned from a trip to Florida with 7 passengers (6 adult sized people plus a toddler) and luggage. Maybe it is because I don't test drive sports cars, but the pro reviewers missed the boat on the CVT and power. 25-27 mpg fully loaded and passing other cars going up the mountains. Too bad Ford dropped this powertrain for more horsepower and poorer mileage. The only problems I have heard about are the premature tire wear and rear brakes. Our tires are ok so far, and we'll see on the brakes. I think the writers did a disservice to this car. The Freestyle is not flashy, but does what it is meant to do.</TEXT>

<TEXT> We went from an Excursion to a Freestyle. We were aprehensive at first but it is roomy and I dont knock my head getting the seats. We have put 7 good sized people in the unit and every on was comfortable we probablt topped the 1125 cargo limit but it showed no adverse signs of handling. On vacation we took the Rocky Mountain passes with again a load close to 1k Berthond , Rabbit ears and on the way bak from Oregon and Califonia The Syskius, Donner and Vale pass aagain very comfortably . For the passengers there is pleny of knee room fro those in the rear seat has more knee room than Volvo or Passatt and more seating area as well </TEXT>
<FAVORITE> I like the handling on our South Carolina secondary roads . I appreciate the kindness at the fuel pump 21 to 24 in town and as high as 27 on the trip west. I like the roominess and reminds me of my first love the 57 Mustang</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Best kept secret by those dummies at Ford. Why promote one of the best vehicles out there? I'm glad they don't, because I would have had to pay a lot more (supply/demand) for mine. Paid $19,200, 12k miles from a dealer. No question the best vehicle I have ever purchased. Put almost 14k miles on it. Had rear brake warranty work done, but other than that, it is flat out the best crossover vehicle out there. 28 mpg on highway. My wife gets 19 mpg in city driving and she likes to go fast. More than acceptable acceleration. If I wanted to go faster, I would have bought a Mustang. Plenty of room inside. Very comfortable to drive. There are deals out there on these. You will not be sorry.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is great for a big vehicle. All kinds of room. Very comfortable on long trips. CVT tranny is cool. I picked up the extended Ford warranty which is solid, along with 4.9 financing. I'm good for 100k or until 2012. More room and a better layout than any minivan. This is a no-brainer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought it used with 13400 miles on it. Have run two fuel tanks through it now in two weeks. Great handling for a big car. Much better than the '06 Taurus it replaced. Comfort, handling and space utilization is outstanding. 2nd and 3rd row seats don't have any legroom issues. Taller people (5'11"+) can't use the 3rd row headrests as they hit the headliner first if they lean back. No issues with upright seating position. Worst issue is that with an 80/20 city/highway mix I'm getting about 16.5 mpg. Worse than I'd expected. Don't think AWD is worth the mileage hit. Engine does get a bit noisy above 2500 rpm. A friend bought an '07 explorer same weekend. He likes mine better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tri-zone climate control. Premium sound CD changer/MP3 rocks. Leather is comfy - though I should have gotten heated seats. Handling much better than expected.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really searched and researched before I bought this car. I wanted a car that would do everything and I got it! It carries people and cargo like a champ. (Even my mountain bike without having to take off the front wheel!) It handles great and I love the CVT - really great on hills, stop and go traffic whatever you hand it. Plenty of Power. I love the cargo well in the back and the way I can flip and realign everything in a flash, on the go, no matter whatever, or whomever, comes up. The versatility is the best I have seen. This car replaces a full sized van and a Taurus and does it with style. We still have the Explorer, but more and more, we keep taking the Freebie. I love this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>First, the comfort. Seats are great. Then, moonroof! Turn up the Sirius radio, and I don't even mind construction zones. Then, the cool 3rd row reverse seats!

<TEXT>I bought the dealership owner's demo model and from the first time I rode in one, I knew I had to have one. Dealership uses the Freestyle for their courtesy cars and I thought I might try to buy one of those but this became available and knowing it had the best of care, I said, "Yes!" Smooth transmission; so very comfortable; and beautiful inside and out. I've only had it a week but wouldn't part with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the Freestyle only a couple of weeks but I can already see that I made the right choice. It drives good in torrential downpours, it handles well on very curvy roads, it hauls 6 family members ages 5-81 nicely and goes onward through the fog without any trouble. The fuel economy hasn't dropped below 20 mpg in city/highway driving which is a plus considering it hasn't hit 1000 miles yet. This crossover should have stayed on the market longer. I really think Ford made a bad decision by dropping it after just 3 years. </TEXT>

<FAVORITE>Realistic 3 row seating, driver comfort. center consoles on front and mid seats. The fold down seats are a breeze to use compared to the mini van I had previously. And we are getting much better mileage than listed. What's not to love?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Some say Freestyle is Fords best kept secret, and it is! Volvo Chassis and structure, Volvo AWD mechanism. 5stars crash protection all categories. Highlight is the CVT Transmission, silky smooth adequate acceleration with no shifting points. CVT provide great real world fuel economy better than EPA, the best fuel efficient V6 crossover in its class. Interior is so quiet like a luxury car, so is the engine. Theater seats in 3 rows, the rear passengers got great views of the road ahead. All seats are 1st class spacious, comfortable. Dash and interior fit and finish look good, the grains and soft surfaces felt fine. Exterior style slowly grew on me, "Go anywhere" look! Smooth over bumps, etc.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth CVT transmission, best crash protection possible in a vehicle, great fuel economy, everyone got good view of the road, quiet ride, it got contemporary styling better than "other" crossovers starting to get weird shapes, lot of room + leg rooms</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Freestyle was a practical choice because rebate plus 0.9% financing saved us thousands over the Odyssey or the Sienna and we got AWD to boot. Wasn't expecting a great car but that's what I got! Handles like a dream, smooth ride, hugs the road on curves, fun to drive. Lots of interior room: third row comfortable even with long legs. Getting 18-19 MPG in town and 24- 25 MPG on the road. Deep well in back gives lots of room for day to day cargo and adequate space for a week's worth of luggage for 6 of us. Has the best temp. control I have ever had in a car, both heat and AC. Set the temp you want and that's where it stays. Plenty of power for my needs, even up the mountains of central PA.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride, excellent temp control, good legroom all three rows, split 3rd row seat allows me to maximize both seating capacity and cargo space as needed, like back-up warning signal</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got back from a LONG trip through many states, including going through the Appalacian mountains. The trip with my family totaled over 2,200 miles. The Freestyle was a great vehicle, offering plenty of room for a family of four with lots of luggage. My experience was that it had PLENTY of passing power. The CVT would ramp up to 5.8K RPM and the car would FLY by anything on the road. Of course, it sounded like the world was coming to an end. Overall, there was not much to complain about. The computer said I averaged ~23 MPG over each tank, which is not bad for a car full of people and luggage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really enjoyed the CVT, which is much better than an automatic trans., though it does take some getting used to. It is odd to hear an engine rev up to 2.5K RPM and stay there as the MPH ramps up. Under moderately heavy acceleration, the RPM sometimes dropped as your speed increases.</FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>We really like the combination of the engine and the CVT. Very smooth and just enough power and plenty when you need it for passing. Fuel mileage has been about 22 combined and 26+ on the one trip we took so far at highway speeds.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought the Freestyle after looking at minivans. No real competitors to this vehicle. Decided to go with the Freestyle after other minivans felt too bulky while driving and the comfort was not as good. Took a 500 mile trip over the weekend, love the ride, very smooth and very comfortable. Also have an Expedition, Freestyle is more comfortrable. Replaced a Honda CRV because it was too noisy, a stiff ride, and fuel useage was no better than 25mpg. Freestyle got 25+ on trip, very good for a heavier vehicle with V6. When compared to CRV it's outstanding.</TEXT>

My nine year old son has no problem flipping the back seats when extra cargo room is needed but it is also great to have seating for six when needed. Car handles very well and is easy to drive.

<TEXT>On a 700+ mile trip across WA to Idaho and back we observed 27.4 and 28.3 average mpg with 60 set on the cruise control. This includes mountain driving/passes. Best observed cumulative average was 31.2 mpg on level ground west of Spokane to central WA. Exceeds expectations since EPA highway is just 24 mpg for AWD. Freestyle allows chains that are required to be carried here in NW going over mountasin passes in winter with AWD/4WD even if you don't have to put them on. One reason we bought the car was because of needing to drive over the mountains in the winter. The GM Acadia owner's manual says no to chains, probably the same for the Outlook and Enclave.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Freestyle is the 19th Ford we've owned. (Started with a '60 Falcon wagon). Still own 7 Fords, including our '66 Mustang convertible. Took the Freestyle on a 4,100 mile road trip five days after purchase! Went through two major snow storms in Colorado. When a F350, 4WD was stuck, we drove around it! Went up on over the Rockies without hesitation. CVT is the best thing ever seen on a mountain pass! The added AWD can't be beat. Interior is comfortable beyond compare. A 7 hour day behind the wheel is hardly noticeable. Everyone who rides in it (including the 3rd row) comments on roominess and visibility being outstanding. Too bad Ford is dropping it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was looking for a SUV crossover type vehicle for my dogs and to move furniture, etc. with ease. My final two choices came down to the Ford Freestyle and the Mazda CX-9. Both vehicles stacked up pretty comparably but Ford tagged at about $10K less than Mazda with the same features at the dealer. LOVE the responsiveness of the Ford in handling and braking. Drives better than many sedan models. Wish it had a little more kick taking off, but glad to sacrifice that for the MPG. The features are great, but the driveability is OUTSTANDING. Keep it up, Ford ---:) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The instrument panel displays readings for every fluid level, tire pressure, fuel cap, etc. Also like the digital compass, mpg reading, trip timer/meter. The stereo is GREAT with the added subwoofer and 6 disc CD. Love the stow-and-go seating in the rear seats and the rear temperature control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the Freestyle after owning several Mercedes, Infiniti and other expensive cars that always were broken and expensive to fix. This Freestyle is wonderful. It is a very user friendly and comfortable design. Everything works and it is comfortable on long trips. I love the silky smooth CV transmission. The car is a nice size. It gets exceptional gas mileage (28 on trips and 21.5 in town) on regular gas. I am very impressed with the quality of this vehicle and like its excellent safety ratings. Ford is building a great car and the 5 year 60,000 warranty is also nice to have. An excellent vehicle and a pleasant surprise.</TEXT>

Bose stereo is great! The interior is better designed than most Japanese cars. This car is deceptive in how much room there is inside. It has more room than my minivan. It rides great and handles well. Great brakes. Engine is low on horsepower. Got a great deal. Comes with 3 year bumper to bumper and 5 year engine warranty which is great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 03 Yukon XL (lemon) and looked for a more fuel efficient wagon with 3 rows. Volvo too expensive. Pacifica close, but price/features no match. Pilot, great vehicle, but mileage like other SUV's. Since it's a Ford, there is no reason why you can't get invoice pricing. Don't believe ads, it's a lie, you'll get about 20 to 25 mpg and there is no way you'll get 500 miles to the tank, unless you're coasting downhill for that many miles. Overall, if you are looking for non SUV, non-minivan, decent room with 3 row seating, fuel economy, feature, content and price, this probably is about the only option. Too bad Toyota, Honda, Nissan had no viable option. May want to check out Mazda CX9.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XC90 based, European firm but not harsh. All seats fold flat. Theater seating, my 6ft frame is comfy in 3rd row. Storage areas. Durable leather seats. Buttoned down styling. Compared to SUV's, you'll get 20 to 50% better mpg. CVT, like driving a golf cart. In-dash CD changer, MP3, dual zone A/C.</FAVORITE>

There is not as much interior space as a minivan but I am over it. The Freesytle is great!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned a minivan and was not expecting much when I bought into the crossover market. However, this car is incredibly fun to drive, and comfortable for everyone. After everything I read about the CVT transmission and the horsepower, I was initially worried it would not have sufficient power; well the critics are wrong, this car has more than ample power. The CVT transmission allows a continuous acceleration until your cruising speed is met. I would recommend this car to anyone needing storage or with a family.</TEXT>
