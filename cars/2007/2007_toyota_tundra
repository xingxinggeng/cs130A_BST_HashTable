<TEXT>When we saw the truck we liked the looks of it right away. When we bought it we fell in love with it. It is the nicest truck we have ever had. WE will go with these always.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned this truck for a little over two years now, and over 100K miles. Aside from a Toyota Celica I had in college, this is the best car/truck I have ever owned. Great reliability, great power, great towing capacity. All I've had done to it is change the oil & rotate the tires every 5K miles and recently, changed the front/rear differential oil. The ribber gaskets around the front doors do come off at the upper corner if you use automatic car washes. That's my only complaint. Fuel mileage is what you would expect for a 5.7L with this much power and torque. I get about 18/Hwy and 16 City.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Toyota I've owned and it's great. I have owned them all. This has been trouble free and I work my trucks hard, I now have 35K on the truck and it's great so far. I lifted the truck since I live in the mountains and the only thing that changed was the mileage, due to height. I would recommend this truck to anyone. The crewmax I really enjoy because I have the back open most of the time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power and the ride are great. All the little things in the truck. Radio, storage, 12v plugs. The truck was well thought out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having owned fords, chevys and everything in between, and using them professionally I can tell you that I haven't made up my mind on this truck. You can't beat the power of the 5.7, but the oil changes are murder. Why Toyota decided to go with cartridge filter and have to pull the skid plate, and use special tools and 5w20 synthetic, who knows??? Tires only lasted 28000 miles. Bad pavement and you get the roller coaster effect. I've already had the torque converter replaced (under warranty). Makes a roaring sound when starting it after not running for four days and I still haven't figure that one out. All the black pieces on the exterior of the truck are beginning to suffer uv damage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this truck for two years. I have had no major problems except excessive uneven wear on the tires which my Orlando dealership did not take seriously. Instrument cluster is hard to read and needs a redesign. Does not pull the boat as well as my Ford Excursion. Next truck will be a F250.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The funnest vehicle I've ever had. After 50,000 miles, averaging 18 MPG. I can get about 480 miles on a tank on the freeway. The power is awesome. This truck replaced my Tacoma, which I loved, but this vehicle is everything I imagined and more. Only maintenance has been the routine stuff. This truck is perfect for pulling my trailer of ATV's, or even just loading one in the bed. I figure I'll get about 100,000 miles and trade it in for a newer model, so my next one will probably be in 2011. Way to go TOYOTA!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love all the room inside, the look of the exterior, the heated mirrors, all the space in the middle console, the lighting inside, multiple light hook-ups for the trailer, and the assisted tailgate is one of my favs. The power of this truck is unreal, and it rides so smooth on the freeway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this truck for two years without a problem. I have the TRD off road version, drive the California freeways regularly and can't complain about the ride. It's stiff, but it's a truck. The 4.7 engine will run with anything although I would like the 5.7 just because I like like power. On trips to Colorado and Arizona I've averaged 19 mpg. This is with a 4:10 rear gear and mountains. I'd buy another. Most reliable I've had.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Southern Ranch Truck</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Bought this hoping to find a rugged, reliable truck that could handle hardcore ranch work - in 4WD most of the time, pulling trailers, hauling a full bed load, running off-road - and the results have been mixed (but better than my previous Silverado and F-250 and my current Dodge Ram 2500). Can't complain about the HP, torque and towing - best I've owned. Have begun to experience reliability problems - not very Toyota-like. Biggest complaint is that the off-road/4WD features are more for show than for utility. I've replaced skid plat twice, bent the hitch, tow hooks are inconvenient, plastic dam gets in the way. If they'd offer a true tough work truck they'd capture the market.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>HP, towing ability, interior styling and room are best of any truck I've owned. Love the cushion-drop tailgate. Workmanship and reliability is also slightly better, but not up to previous Toyota standards. Body metal is OK. They'd do well to consult with offroaders on improvements to toughen-up. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck rides and handles well enough that even the wife doesn't mind driving it. It's comfortable for my 6-2 large frame even on a 300 mile straight through drive (which is the freeway distance you will go between fill-ups). Fit and finish is outstanding. Treat it gently as the sheet metal is paper thin and dents can accumulate very easily. The same applies to the paint job (paper thin). Have had the truck for a year and a half and have had no warranty issues whatsoever. This won't replace a Ford F250, but you'd be better off buying it over a F150. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It looks and drives like a luxury truck but it really is a work truck. I can use it during the week to haul heavy loads or use it at a construction site and on the weekends, go to a wedding or nice outings all in the same truck. It's got power and class. The best vehicle I ever owned. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Doug Tachi</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>As a tow vehicle the engine, with 401 ft. lbs. of torque coupled with a six speed transmission and 4.30 final drive ratio, is a lot closer to diesel performance than I had expected. The other surprise is general acceleration. Right off the showroom floor, typical stop light to stop light runs leave many "performance" cars struggling to keep up. The seats and seating position are very comfortable and except for the interior design of the dash, Toyota engineering has raised the bar for trucks in this class. So far it's been a win-win situation. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine and drivetrain are the crown jewels for this vehicle, clearly outclassing anything in its field of 1/2 ton trucks. The general level of driver comfort is also a big plus at the end of a hard day. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In my opinion, this is the best truck on the market. I have grown up with Ford trucks my whole life but because of recent problems, not anymore. About 2 months ago I wanted to take an 07 Tundra for a test drive and was sold. I love this truck! I say that everyday. I have a family of 5 and there is plenty of comfortable room for all of us. Also for such a big truck, with a lot of power the mpg was not bad at all (compared to other same size trucks). I intend on driving this truck for a long time and if it is anything like my parents' Toyota trucks, I will be. Also, this truck has more than enough towing power for my boat to and from the launch and also for the quads to the woods.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I think this truck runs, idles and shifts really smooth with plenty of power. Even on the highway it drives very smooth with easy to use cruise control. I also love the way the front looks like a bulldog! Plenty of interior room with plenty of power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a truck. After multiple GMCs and Fords, this thing really gives you a confidence. I liked my GMCs and Chevys, but the issues really started to show up at around 50-60k miles. I've owned numerous Toyota cars and love the reliability, ride and handling quality and reliability. The 5.7 engine is amazing. Absolute and instant power. The tranny is perfectly matched and smooth. Test drive one. You'll buy it.</TEXT>

I owned a Ford F-150 before this one, but the Toyota is very far ahead in technology. I'm not tired anymore when I drive back from work. Driving with this truck is fun became my passion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove both the 5.7 V8 and the 4.7L V8 and decided on the 4.7L because I didn't need the towing capacity and wanted a truck that had more options for the price (instead of the the bigger engine). The 270hp/313lb-ft 4.7L is more than adequate for my commute and the occasional tow. Coupled with the 5 speed it is surprisingly nimble in traffic (I must compliment the 5.7L V8 though - the test drive ALMOST had it sold. That truck moves effortlessly.) The truck bed is huge and it's difficult to reach over the side to get anything (I'm 5'11"). The ride is comfortable, but the interior isn't as nice as the Silverado (as expected). Overall it's great - no buyer's remorse here!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall the Tundra is Okay, they have fianlly matched the big 3 in terms of lower quality, this is my 4th Tundra and the worst one thus far. I have a steering wheel vibration that I have been to the dealer 5 times now and it is still not repaired. The paint is very frail,I have to say that Ford is light years ahead on Paint quality! I own 40 Trucks so I know! The interior paint on the dash is poor quality as well, have many scratches already! The plastic dash cluster is also very cheaply made! The leather seats are fairly nice. the ride quality is fair except for the constant vibrating of the steering wheel. It makes your hands numb on a longer trip! The sheet metal panels-thin!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Tundra replaced a 1999 Suburban that was my work truck but just had too many reliability issues. The Tundra offered a configuration plus Toyota's reputation for reliability and durability. The Suburban was a great design and even as a work vehicle it was tough but just too many of the components died an early death. The Tundra is roomy, quite, powerful and came with a kicking stereo even though it is not a priority for me as this is a work truck. I've put about 1100 miles so far and the ride, though choppy on concrete segmented roads, has smoothed out and of course, is much better with a load in the bed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I've owned them all. I own a construction company and needed a truck that has a high towing capacity and horsepower rating. I've put 21,500 miles on the 5.7L and has not proved to be what I expected. I am very hard on trucks but am adamant about service every 3k miles, and fuel filter every 12k. At 6800 miles the valve train started making noise so I took it in to discover my truck had leaked over a quart of oil in a 4 month period. My engine was totally overhauled. I was hauling a 9k trailer up the grapevine and my tranny overheated and would not shift.. had to wait till it cooled down.. weak.. Now brakes are shuddering. Toyota and quality don't go together anymore. Will be my last.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this truck to pull a 30 ft 7K lb trl. It does it like a dream. It will out pull my buddies Excursion with a 6.0 diesel, a 2500 dodge with a cummins and a 5.3 chevy pick up. All with shorter and lighter trailers. Here in PA we have quite a few big hills and it handles both sides great. The fuel economy is a little stiff. If the fuel tank were larger this could help out. Too many stops along a trip. I used to have a 96 suburban with a 6.5 turbo diesel. the only thing that was better on it than the new tundra is the size of the fuel tank (40 gal vrs 24.6), I was able to go 5-8 hours of towing with one tank. The new tundra needs to stop every 3-4 hours. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck meets all my expectations derived from owning two previous Toyota trucks. The regular cab has large doors with large windows which make for unsurpassed visibility. The storage area behind the seats is completely practible. While some reviews have complained about the ride, I find it very acceptable. The room and comfort of the cab make long trips a delight. The engine/transmission package is smooth and provides ample power for my needs. If I towed a large trailer, I would opt for the 5.7 V8. Overall, its a workhorse of truck that I can depend on that drives well too. Gas mileage is about what I expected, 17-18 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Tundra for over a month now and it has been a phenomenal vehicle. I moved from a car to a truck, so the fuel economy is definitely not as good, but for its size and power I am very impressed. Some say the interior is not as polished as other makes, I do agree, but boy it is easy to clean, and the material used feels very durable, exaclty what is needed in a work truck. I actually love the material use and design layout, except for a few hard to reach buttons on the right side of the center console, they are pretty far from the drivers seat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drivetrain is absolutely outstanding, ride quality is awesome, literally no road noise (very quiet cabin), comfort on long trips, overall look of the vehicle, 4 doors instead of an access cab, and its looks, oh and I actually like the guage layout, unlike some people who say it is very separated.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ordered My Tundra in February 2007 but was not delivered until May 2007. Factory did not install daylight driving lights or stainless running boards as ordered. Both local dealer and Toyota (Detroit) advised DRL must be installed at factory and could not install after and was considered an aftermarket item and not recommended. The factory installed DRL was about $40. I purchased a DRL kit for $97 and paid an electronics shop $187 to install a fairly complicated wiring job. Toyota took no responsibility for the omission. They did, however, install the SS running boards free of charge. This is the first new vehicle (among many) I have had that I did not have to return for some problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had this truck for about three weeks, but I'm so glad I bought it. This is my first Toyota and after driving it I'm sure it won't be my last. I've been a loyal Dodge fan for nearly 20 years, but the Tundra beats it hands down. It has more room, a much better ride, more power, more standard features... simply more. I loved the look of my '02 Ram and still think the '02 through '05 models are the best looking trucks on the road. The current styling and lack of options are what made me look at the Tundra. I am sure glad I did. It was by far the best choice I've made on a vehicle for a long time. I couldn't be happier with this truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5.7L engine has ridiculous amounts of power. Puts you back in the seat by just thinking about stepping on the gas pedal. Interior is extremely roomy and the seats are very comfortable.

<TEXT>First off this truck is a short bed not a long bed. Edmunds does not offer a choice for the short bed. I have the 5.7 V8 and it is bad to the bone. I have driven this about 1500 miles. Most of these miles were a road trip from Texas to Florida. I have no complaints with performance or reliability. This truck is Toyota's standard work truck but I plan to make it my sports truck. I am impressed with the options that are on this standard truck (dual zone climate control, mp3 player plug, transmission temp guage etc.). Also this truck is four wheel drive which is an added bonus. By the way I feel I got this truck much cheaper than I could get a Ford or Chevy. Fuel mileage so far 17.3/14.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a longbed doublecab 5.7 SR5 2wd. I traded a Silverado 2500 crewcab, and was counting on the TV ads to be accurate. The ads lead you to believe that although it is a half-ton truck, it is almost a 3/4 ton. Not even close! If you are a person who drives to the office and parks the truck, picks up some lumber on the weekend, and tows the boat to the lake on the weekend, then this is a wonderful truck. If you work out of your truck and carry heavy loads, then be prepared to be let down. It is a light duty 1/2 ton truck. The tires are rim protectors, not truck tires and can inflate to only 44 lbs, not 70lbs like a real truck tire. The suspension is soft. But I like the truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The transmission is better than the engine - computerized, seamless shifts, knows when to downshift. 5.7 engine is the best gas engine I have driven ever. Tow mirrors are excellent. Bucket seats w/ console are large and comfortable. A/C is very quiet. If they make a 3/4 ton, I'll buy one.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the Timbermica green with the tan interior. 5.7 4x4 TRD. Two words: love it! The wife fell in love with it as soon as she drove it. It handles great, and for a truck with an off road package I don't think the ride is that bad. Fit and finish is great, and there is plenty of room on the inside for traveling or loading up the family for a Sunday outing. The 5.7 is quite and powerful. I would buy it again in a heart beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I shopped the Ford F150, Dodge Ram 1500 and the Silverado before buying the Tundra. The horsepower and torque are incredible. The 6-speed transmission shifts very smoothly. I got the JBL stereo upgrade, but thought it was overpriced (see comments below). If you get a 4X4, make sure you get step bars (very tall). Best fuel economy compared to other trucks in this class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first time that I have bought a Toyota product after owning GM and Ford products. I traded in my Chevy for a radiant red Toyota Tundra. The Tundra offers so much power in the engine that it is almost dangerous! My three kids fit in the back of my double cab and have room to spare. My wife and I have to shout to each other because there is so much room in the front! There is so much storage space that has been thoughtfully placed. This is one excellent truck at an affordable price. This is the best purchase ever for me! :)</TEXT>

It seems to have very good road manners, tracks very straight and stops very straight. It is fast and very smooth, like a luxury sedan. It is also a big vehicle and you sit quite tall in the saddle. My truck is equipped with a lot of the extras that come standard on the CrewMax Limited, but my truck was $4300 less than a Limited, so I feel like I got a very good value for my money. The fit and finish are fantastic. It is the first vehicle I have ever owned where I can find no blemishes, interior or exterior.</TEXT>

Being a female, I wasn't sure about a truck but I love it. It's fun to drive and handles well. Yes it drives like a truck because it is one. We purchased an ARE cap and a bed rug for when we bring our two large dogs.

<TEXT>Recently purchased a new Toyota Crewmax with 5.7L engine. This truck outperforms all my expectations. The only item that I would like to see is a better interior on the limited edition. Can't complain about the gas mileage as it is a large V8 engine. Driving in the rocky mountains up steep passes doesn't even phase the engine or the 6 speed transmission. Features such as the back up camera and sonar are an ease to use for parking. The rear seats easily sit my friends who are over 6'3" tall. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was a GMC and F150 owner for years. After my 2006 F150 broke down the 4th time I drove it straight to the Toyota dealer and traded it in. I felt guilty at first , but than learned The Toyota was designed and built in the U.S. (much more so than the F150 !).This truck may cost a little more, but you get way more for the money, the build quality is far superior, it tows like an animal, and with only 1500 miles it is getting better gas mileage than the f150 already. I get compliments on it all the time. It is sharp enough to take my girlfriend to a nice restaurant, and strong enough to haul my race car to the track. The last time I towed, it was up hills in 108 degree heat - no sweat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned Chevy Sub. for 12 yrs. Proved to be a good truck overall. Wanted diesel Ford. Didn't want to pay diesel Ford prices. Anyway, this Tundra is one nice truck. The power is unbelievable. Freeway MPG is 19.5. When engine is cold, it has a slight clatter sound, almost like a super quiet diesel. Sound goes away when warm. Ride is good on smooth roads, washboards a little (lot) on CA highway slab. 250lb+ Snug Top helped. Interior noise should not be used in the same sentence when referring to this truck. It is quiet. Interior design is clean and straightforward. Nobs are big and easy to use. Goes into 4H fine, but clunks when going to 2H under acceleration.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 3 Silverados and 2 F-150s. This is my first Toyota truck. The 5.7 is as powerful as advertised and for such a large vehicle (5600+ lbs), gas mileage has averaged around 17.5. As the Toyota name would imply, the build quality and fit and finish are super. The AC is the coldest of any vehicle I've ever owned. The Crewmax has an extraordinary amount of room for those with a family. I'm 6'0" and can sit in back seat with seat pulled fully forward and still cannot touch the front seat with my knees. Ride quality is very good, but not quite as smooth as the new GM products. (Still a 9/10, though.) No rattles or squeaks. The six speed and the manumatic shift is silky smooth.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Enormous amounts of power. Good fuel mileage for large vehicle. Six speed tranny and enough room for everyone to stretch out. Toyota build quality.

<TEXT>Tundra finally hit a home run with the 2007 with the 5.7L/6AT Limited model. I spent the extra $$ to get this package (along with the Nav. and 20" wheels) and have not regretted it in the least. The drivetrain on this 2007 Tundra is perhaps the finest combo ever put into a production model pickup. The advertised 16/20 mpg is accurate unless you have a heavy foot, and the cabin quietness is Lexus-like. 40 grand is a steep price for a half- ton pickup but anyone in the market for a high-end truck would be crazy not to go to your local Toyota dealership and test drive a Tundra. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in 2003 Tundra, never had a problem except tranny a bit clunky when shifting. Very quiet comfortable ride. Wife hated previous tundra, loves this one. Two compaints: first, contrary to claim that truck is xm ready, it is not. You have to spend about $600 to use this feature (parts and labor) not including subscription. Second, the truck is extremely bouncy on anything other than smooth roads. I did discover that the tires came 10 lbs over pressurized and when I dropped it to mfg sugg. pressure it did improve it quite a bit but still not as smooth as my previous Tundra.

The bed is a few inches deeper than most trucks and the spring loaded hinges on the tail gate are really cool. I've had this truck for a week and I can't find a thing wrong with it's design. The mpg is a little bit lower than stated. My computer is telling me I'm getting 12 mpg in town and 15 mpg on the fwy. Don't really mind spending a little more on gas to have all this power.

<TEXT>I have the TRD package and this is the worse riding vehicle I have ever owned. On a good road, the ride is ok. On a freeway where the road is segmented cement blocks (most old freeways in California) you had better have your seat belt fastened if you want to stay in the cab. I am being told by Toyota that is in the TRD package. Maybe. I drove the GMC Sierra and picked the Tundra due to power. Big mistake. This is the only problem I have with the truck but it is a major one and this truck will be the first and last Tundra I own. If you want a good ride, stay away from this truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the extended cab, and have been highly dissapointed. I was attracted to the design, and that did not dissapoint. I have been highly dissapointed otherwise. The engine in this truck is noisy especially when towing. It revs real hig with a load, and despite the commercials, I do not feel confident hauling as I did with my Dodge. Fuel economy is averageing about 11 MPG city/highway. Build quality is substandard. Cracked and loose plastic trim. I hate the instrument panel- very poorly designed but the outside makes up for it. Seats are hard and uncomfortable as is the ride- especailly over rutted pavement and is unbearable on dirt roads. I think this will be my last Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For all the previous tries by Toyota, this is a dead center bullseye to what I was looking for in a truck. I've owned two Fords and three GM trucks. Nothing I've owned compares to the power and performance of this new Toyota. The 5.7 and a light foot (which is admittedly hard to do) actually make for a not so thirsty beast. The center console is huge. In my opinion, the interior design, however, is not tops in the segment as the GM trucks have the nicest interiors. Toyota has too many different shades and types of plastics on the dash. Fit and finish is as you'd expect a Toyota to be, top notch. However I have noticed a dash rattle from the a pillar on some roads. A true fullsize.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased the '07 Tundra. I've had it about 3 weeks now. It's the Limited, DoubleCab, 6.5' bed, 5.7 V8, 4x4. This truck is amazing. I've only ever owned F150s ever since I learned to drive. What a change this truck is. The power and handling is amazing. Not only does it corner like a sports sedan, but it will stop shorter than any truck I've ever driven. The engine and transmission are smooth and quiet. When you want the power though, it does come to life and lets you know it. Good thing for the traction control or the tires would only spin. Gas mileage isn't bad. I'm getting 18.5 mpg on the highway and 14.5 mpg in the city. That's driving sensibly though.</TEXT>

My only compaint would be it is a little hard to get into and rides a little on the stiff side for a 1/2 ton. Brakes, comfort, tranny, motor and initial quality is near perfect!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2002 Tundra that I never had a problem with. The 2007 has all the little things that I wished for on my 2002. Ride is great but stiffer than the older one, which I like, but I do have the off road suspension which makes it slightly stiffer. Get all kinds of looks and thumbs up on the road. Interior comfortable and easy to operate controls. It is definitely full size and the 5.7 is sooooo much fun to drive even when you are not towing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this truck with reservations because it was made in my home state. Give me back my Ford F-150 with 245,000 miles on it! This truck has been nothing but dissapointing. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, the dash looks like it was pieced together by a dozen differnt designers, and guages are obstructed by the steering wheel. With a load, this truck struggles. Interior and exterior Trim pieces are loose- nothing major and I fixed them myself- but not what I expected from a $30,000+ vehichle. Truck looks aggresive and heavy, and it handles as such. The truck seems to struggle around the corners and rides rough. Nothing what I expected with Toyota's so-called "quality"</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned the truck for 3 months now and have absolutely no regrets on the purchase. I've had a turnover ball gooseneck hitch installed to allow towing of our 3 horse slant load trailer. Pulls it without any negative effects. The 6-speed auto transmission is a real smooth shifter and the ride is good also (a major influence in the purchase along with the available power). The extendable tow mirrors are also a hit with me, let you see much more of the road behind you than any other mirror I have used. My in-laws say riding in the rear seat is like riding in a car only the truck is much easier to get in and out of. Overall great truck! Toyota sure hit the mark on this one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power to tow. Power to haul. Lots of power! Tailgate gas strut makes light work of opening and closing it. Separate front seat temp control is something I will no longer do without and the optional underseat storage box (double cab) is perfect for keeping tools/accessories quiet and out of the way.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this pickup. I had just purchased an 07 chevrolet silverado about 4 months ago, just got this, and am now wondering why I ever bought the Chevy. It has much better acceleration, more stylish, more towing, more payload, and overall better build quality also. I never much cared for the Tundras til this year, when they gave it a face lift. It's now bigger and beefier than ever. I'm a big guy, 6'4" 265 lbs, and I fit in it a whole lot better than I did the Chevy. It has a lot more interior space, and I love the floor shifter. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Toyota truck, the first two being Tacomas. My first impression was how smooth and quiet the ride was, almost as good as our 2001 Avalon. The front seats are much higher (almost chair height) than the Tacoma and thus more comfortable on long hauls. Even my 6.5 foot bed is huge with approx. 66 cubic feet of room. The interior controls are very big and easy to turn while driving. Love the fact that like my Tacoma the rear door windows go all the way down when opened. And the guy that came up with the tailgate assist should get a raise. Also the standard Tire Pressure Monitor system is a plus. And did I mention standard VSC, ABS, TRAC, EBD and the huge (13.9 in) front brakes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The feature I like the best is not even touted much by Toyota, the Artificial Intelligence shifting control. I was driving in the mountains of PA and noticed that when going down hills and using the brakes often the engine would automatically shift down thus saving my brakes. Love this feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have about 800 miles on my truck and its ride is awful. It literally bounces down the road. Although it has 4WD and an 8 foot bed, it was delivered with passenger tires! I have replaced them with 10 ply Goodyear tires but the ride is still bouncy due to 2 ply side walls. I plan to replace them again with BF Goodrich A/T tires which have 3 ply sidewalls. Hopefully this will cure the problem. The truck is beautiful but is a monster to drive. Visibility is awful and it's dangerous to back up. Towing mirrors have two side mirrors on each side which makes it confusing to check vehicles coming up on you. Toyota did not do their homework on this one and I would return it to the dealer if I could. </TEXT>

The back seat dwarfs my daughter's car seat and I, at 6'6", can sit in the back seat with extra leg room. I have the moon roof and don't seem to have any issues with headroom. The truck is big and strong. The body panels don't seem to be as solid as my 4Runner or Tacoma I sold, but it probably is because of its sheer size. The 5.7L motor is the strongest engine I have ever driven in a gasoline truck. I think Toyota is finally able to compete with the full size domestic trucks. Absolutely elated!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this truck. I have owned 3 reg cab short bed 2wd chevy silverado's w/ the 5.3. I almost bought another but at the last minute, I dedcided to just go check out the new Tundra. I am all about performance and without even driving the reg cab short bed 5.7, I ordered one. I drove the crew max 4x4 and it had more get up and go than the above mentioned chevy. Yeah it's got a bigger engine but also a lot more weight. I have absolutely no regrets. The performance is ridiculous. I mean it hauls serious booty. It looks mean, rides smooth, and gets there with the quickness. It's not a work truck and I don't haul or pull anything. So in short I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS TRUCK!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>All the talk and ads stated just how great this truck is and it just isn't. Just bought it and if I could return it, it would be back at the dealership now. It produces 381 horses, but at 5600 rpm and redlines just over 5000 rpm. You can't use the so called power when you want it or need it. I transported a solid wood desk that two guys physically placed in the bed. Drove just over 56 miles and used almost 1/4 tank of gas. I can say that because I just filled up the truck next door to the furniture store and drove home. Estimated gas rate is 15 to 19, real world really getting 12 on the highway. I don't drive much city traffic. If you want a truck do your reading and look it over well. The brochure told me what I needed to know, but I let others tell me otherwise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am extremely happy with our Crew Max. Our truck appears to be very "tight", with excellent build quality. The only problem noted in my opinion is the engine idle speed at initial start. The engine seems to rev up high @ 1600 rpm. The 5.7 liter engine appears to be well designed & can do what Toyota claims it can in terms of towing. The interior Crew Max leg room is outstanding. We have two kids who can basically stretch out & sleep in the back in comfort on long trips. I have owned a couple of Toyota trucks in the past. I can truthfully say without hesitation that Toyota has done another excellent job. I truly hope this initial model doesn't have any "bugs" or flaws to iron out. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the exterior design. 5.7 liter engine. Build quality. Fit & finish are excellent. TRD suspension. Check the 5.7 liter engine compartment.

<TEXT>The Toyota Tundra is a relatively good truck, the 5.7 is powerful and the 6 speed auto is excellent. It is very quiet and roomy and quite comfortable, however it does have its drawbacks. The climate controls and radio controls are hard to reach. The side walls of the bed are too tall making it hard to reach things in the bed. The gauges are too deep making it difficult to get good info quickly. Bottomline is that once the competition adopts a bigger engine and a new 6 speed auto the Tundra will not have anything to brag about. It is a good truck but I would prefer a F-150 or a Silverado anyday.</TEXT>

We don't haul anything big like trailers, but we do a lot of activities like paddling, fishing, diving, surfing and wanted something that was nice, reliable and could go anywhere. The truck is thirsty and living on Maui with no freeways probably doesn't help fuel consumption. However we did choose the Bigger V8 for fun and not fuel consumption. Taken the 4x4 TRD off road and I have not had to put it into 4 LOW. Truck is too wide to get into areas that most jeeps can get too. I've put 10,000 miles in 6 months and changed the oil twice.

<TEXT>Excellent truck so far but I have a few nits: In the interior the hard plastic dash could have been better. For example, a rubberized feel like on an Audi - especially on the Limited you would expect better materials. The shift knob is massive. And I wish you could disable the very annoying seatbelt alarm, and auto locking doors when you put the truck in drive. The shift gate makes it annoying putting the truck in reverse, and the sport shift mode is too slow changing gears after you have slapped it back or forward. The leather heated seats are a 10/10 though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I purchased this vehicle less than a year ago to be our primary vehicle. We've regretted buying it every day since! Toyota won't tell you there's a very real "bed-bounce" problem on many freeways (particularly Southern California) and the fuel economy isn't nearly as good as they claim. The truck hesitates at times, too, when you try to accelerate (because of towing differential) from a stop. It's not a $40,000 luxury car. It's a very nice "work" truck, but do not buy this truck if you want a comfortable drive on most concrete freeways! If you drive with infants or children, do not endanger them by putting them in this truck!! </TEXT>

The 5.7 that?s in it will hold you tight in your seat. I tested three 07 trucks before I saw this one, I got in the CrewMax and I was sold. For the same prices of the others you get so much more, motor, room, style, and "fun" from this truck. You better like attention, everybody looks when you pull up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5.7 with the 6 speed tranny, dash, in cab storage, 12 volt plugs everywhere, reclining rear seats, roomy, size, the list goes on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There are design flaws in the new 2007 Tundra. The head room is insufficient and I must lean forward to see when a stop light turns green. This makes for a rather unenjoyable ride. I'm 6'2" so unless you're shorter than 5'11" you probably will have the same problem I have. I wish Toyota could explain why they needed to make this truck bigger then the last because there is less head room on this one than the last. Hope they fix it because it's close to being a great truck like the last model was.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Tundra for a month now and pulled a 23' camper "1970 model" so it was pretty heavy. I had no troubles, I had to go up and down a mountain. The brakes stop wonderfully. I pulled the mountain going around 45 mph no problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Generally, I really like this truck. It does take a little getting used to as it is very large and it is quite a challenge to look over the hood for any type of parking manuvers. Overall performance competence is strong and capable and I use the Tundra primarily for pulling a large trailer which it does admirably. My first tank of fuel gave me 19.7 MPG overall, while not pulling a trailer. This vehicle is rated at 16 city and 20 hwy. I am actually pleased that I went ahead and got the Double Cab option as I have found that it is kind of nice to be able to carry not only "stuff" but passengers as well. This truck is tall, even though I am 6'2", I still need to stretch up to get in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 4 dr instead of access cab is such an improvement that along with the extended cab and 6'6" bed I feel that I truly have the best of both worlds. While it's the small V8, I have never felt underpowered and actually have to watch it from over accelerating and burning rubber. Along with the looks, driving is a great rush. I would advise anyone to take a hard look at the Tundra DC 4.7,4WD, it's not too shabby. Can't believe how nice this truck is, even my wife loves it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Besides the obvious, I just love to drive this truck.! It handles best of any truck I've ever driven. and tows my 4090# Caddy (on a master-tow dolly) like it wasn't even there (this without trailer brakes on the dolly!). Second and not far behind is the bench seat combo-armrest very handy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been in many trucks. And lived with only Chevy in the garage. Yet here comes a redesigned, powerful, and fun to drive contender that after driving the others has landed the space in my garage next to my IROC Z. Great style in the interion and a "beefy" upgrade to the exterior really helped to make the final choice. Dodge, Ford and Chevy all really had all the power I would need, but, the interior room and design are superior in the Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned more than 10 trucks in 10 years. I'm in the accessory business with a great relationship with all brand dealers. Great power, brakes, smooth tranny, and imposing looks. Does not ride any better than chevy or ford, a little better than dodge. Leans a lot in corners, but it is big for a 1/2 ton. Interior is a funny combination of materials and colors, but functions well. Mileage is close to 15 city, close to 20 at 65 mph. 17.8 at 80 mph. Wind noise is more than acceptable but slightly annoying over 70. It will be more difficult to get aftermarket wheels as they have changed the bolt pattern. Billet grille and steps are now available.

<TEXT>I have been driving this truck (TRD Offroad, 5.7L) for 3 weeks now, and have found very little to pick on. The truck is powerful, quiet and refined. The suspension handles rough roads well, and the steering is responsive. The auto/man transmission allows the use of the transmission for braking, making quick slow downs or stops easy. The turning radius is excellent for a truck this size, making it maneuverable in tight spots. The seats are comfortable and the cab has plenty of space for 5 adults. Some of my buddies who are hard core Chev and Ford truck enthusiasts are impressed with what they see. My last truck was an '03 Tundra Ltd, and I feel this truck represents a big step ahead.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just picked up my 2007 Toyota Tundra 4.7L Limited Edition 4X4 Double Cab With TRD Off Road Package. Ths is the first full sized truck and 4X4 I have ever owned. It is huge, really comparable to the Dodge Rams I use at work, maybe even bigger. Anyways, I got the Limited, and the ride is so quiet and smooth inside the cabin. The suspension soaks up all road irregularities. The JBL sound system with Bluetooth phone capabilities works flawlessly. There are enough cup holders in this truck to hold probably a case of soda! A lot of indoor storage space, with 2 glove compartments. My leather seats are so soft and comfortable. I love this truck. This is one fantastic truck that I would recommend to anyone who wants a full sized truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My new CrewMax Limited rocks! The ride is smooth, the power is great and all I've heard is positive comments from all of my friends on the appearance!! My previous truck was a 93 Toyota King Cab V6, which I just sold last night, with 210,000 miles and it still ran like a charm. I also own an 01 Toyota Sienna and have had nothing but luck with it. Toyota consistently builds a wonderful product and if price is your concern, you make up for that in quality, reliability and resale value. Thanks Toyota, you did it again!</TEXT>

Only draw back, the bed walls are so high, it is hard to reach in and put stuff in the bed or remove it. I did not get the running boards on the truck when I bought it. I recommend the steps; trucks are so new, not much for after market gadgets for the 07 yet.

<TEXT>The Tundra has plenty of power and drives very smoothly. It can readily handle the twisty roads and hills of WV. The handling is responsive and it's easy to park. It rides high enough to see ahead. I haven't towed with it yet, but the power is evident and I don't expect any problem at all. I really love this truck. A lot of computerized stuff like all vehicles, but all works as advertised and no glitches. Lots of gauges so I know what's going on, including a tire pressure warning light. I liked that air and the 6 speed auto trans are standard features. And Toyota adds enough nice touches that it doesn't look like a basic "work" truck. </TEXT>

Borla has headers and a true chambered exhaust coming out soon, some other companies are too and with underdrive pullies... oh yeah.Take a look under the hood, looks like big block hiemi type heads (similar). The 2 piece (1 alumium and 1 steel) is another nice design. This really is a great truck. Traded a 2005 Silverado LS Z71 and I like this truck a lot more.

All the power you will ever need. Don't listen to all the little complaints about the interior. The stereo and AC controls are in the right place. There is not one thing that I would change about this monster. The Ash interior looks great with the black. Go with the TRD package in order to get the fog lights, all-terrain wheels, skid plates, and wheels. The stereo is as good as anything I've heard.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our original plan was to get the 2006 because we liked the body size of that Tundra. The reason we decided on the 2007 was the 5.7L engine. We have a 20 foot cabin cruiser and liked the towing capacity of the bigger engine and the fuel economy over the 4.7L. Now that we have had the truck a little while we are getting used to how really big it is! Our dog, who doesn't like traveling at all likes the floor of the back seat with the seats up. We just got a tri-fold bed cover so storing our luggage there will be great. We love the navigation and back-up camera and ability to have bluetooth and MP2 plug. Overall, we love it.

Recently towed a 32' travel trailer 500 miles and it was an effortless tow for the 5.7 V8. So far, truck has been trouble free. I love the extra space behind the front seats. Added a rubber mat in that area to keep things from sliding around. The truck is easy to get around in the woods while hunting. In my experience short wheelbase trucks are much more fun to drive and have fewer vibrations and wheel balancing problems than extended cab models. I love driving this truck. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Short wheelbase makes it very maneuverable, room behind front seats, quiet cab, plenty of power for towing and no problems</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall I'm happy. Great power. Haul heavy loads all the time and have had no issues with ride. Ride actually gets better as the bed is weighted. Empty bed on rough roads cause entire truck to resonate... this is common in trucks though. Inside plastic; radio and dash material is cheap (planned to get aftermarket nav as it has better features). Bluetooth is actually no good, no one can hear me clearly. JBL subwoofer under rear seat is poorly placed, should have stuck it behind the seat. Center channel on dash makes noise if covered up with paper. Rear head rests obstruct view. No memory seats, rear ac vents or step lights standard on DC Limited? I couldn't get a moonroof on the DC.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5.7 engine's power, inside seating, power folding mirrors, in/out styling, ride and performance is great with a load. 6 spd transmission shifts smoothly. Homelink. Center armrest is nice and well thought out. </FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>Brakes, brakes, brakes. I can't say enough about the braking ability on this truck. Low end torque makes towing my boat (Tahoe 215CC, aboout 3000 lbs) seem like it's not even back there, and this is in the 4.7L. Handling is very good as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my new 07 Toyota tundra crewmax in june 07. Three weeks after I bought it small paint chips started comeing off it. Toyota said all they would paint the two passenger side doors. I said I didn't think the paint would ever match. Besides it's only three weeks old. They said take it to your dealership. See what they can do for you. When I did that I noticed pen size chips coming off the driver's side. So now its the whole truck.

<TEXT>I'm 41 years old and have owned trucks from Dodge, Chevy, GMC, Ford, and now Toyota (I have no brand loyalty). Without a doubt, this is by far the worst vehicle I have ever owned!! I've had so many problems, I'm not sure where to begin. I have owned the truck for 5 months, and it has 9100 miles. That may seem like a lot, but I usually drive about 35k miles a year (so it should have about 17k miles, not 9). Why the low miles? Because, it spends all it's time in the shop. Engine, brakes, paint (2 complete paint jobs on a brand new truck...downright criminal), transmission (on its third), ECM, constant engine codes, dash rattle, rusting bumpers, ignition stuck, bad drive shaft. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always been impressed with Toyota's quality and resale value. When they moved into the 1/2 ton market with their original offering, however, I was not impressed at all. No head room, no shoulder room, no leg room, small bed. The 2007 Tundra fixed all that and then some. The reason I chose the Tundra over the GMC Sierra (my 2nd choice) was the 5-speed and 6-speed transmission offerings versus the old 4-speed in the GMC. Have had the truck now for ten months. Not a single problem. Very nice truck and a very nice platform to build on. Good job, Toyota!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of compliments. 5-speed transmission. Center console size (I run a computer-stand setup in my mobile office and use the center console to hold my mouse pad).

<TEXT>This is one solid built truck! A few weeks ago, I loaded the following items into the bed of my Tundra: 15 rolls of sod, twenty (40 lb) bags of top soil, and two (50 lb) bags of pea gravel and easily hauled everything home in one trip! The dual hitch plugs on the back of the truck and the extending side mirrors are great features when towing my boat all over the Midwest. The transmission on my Tundra is real smooth & quiet and I had no problems with it while towing a boat through the steep & twisting hills of eastern Kentucky. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Towing & hauling power are fantastic. I get good gas mileage towing a boat on the highway. The extended side mirrors are very useful when towing a boat.

<TEXT>I?ve had my crew cab for less than a year now and it?s junk. I have had three major failures (A/C condenser failure, radio failure and wiper transmission failure) and numerous other problems in the first year. Every time something fails it involves two trips to the dealer. The first to find the problem and then the second a week later once they get parts in. I work too far from the dealer for them to shuttle me to work and I?ve been in so many time that they won?t give me a loaner unless they keep the truck over night so every trip to the dealer means at least a half day off from work (one full day per problem for the two trips). I'm still waiting on parts to fix the AC and radio. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have owned or worked out of 14 different trucks in the last 10 years and can safely say that this vehicle has by far the worst ride of them all. The amount of reverberation from the rear of the truck on concrete roads is insane. Hitting a speed bump at 10mph causes shockwaves to travel up to the front of the truck for 5 seconds while the bed bounces up and down like a diving board. This problem is supposedly only confined to the DC models so do yourself, and your pancreas, a favor and get the crew- max. Toyota has been told repeatedly about the ride issues with the DCs and still refuses to aknowledge it. I will be trading in this back killer as soon as I can.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Toyota Tundra is a nice truck, but I have a few complaints: the engine sounds like a diesel until it warms up, the ride is jarring, and it is hard to see when backing up. Toyota seems to use a lot of cheap plastic material; some have started to discolor already. When I ask the dealership for help on issues that seem to be abnormal it all ends up being normal; like the clattering engine, the vibration in the steering wheel and cupping tires, and transmission down shifting.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this powerful half ton thinking it would run like my 9 year old tacoma. The ride is simply awful. I as well as my passengers are literally bouncing off our seats being held in by our seat belts. I don't dare have my new born in the truck as a passenger. After waiting a year for a promised fix from Toyota for the rough ride I could wait no longer and traded it in for a GMC Sierra. Lost a bit of power but man is the ride better. Problems during my 9 months of ownership: the rubber sealant around the windows were replaced. The driver's side mirror was replaced. The torque convertor was replaced. The transmission was being looked at due to hesitation-vibration.</TEXT>

I drive it, don't abuse it. Fun to drive, turns heads, durable, not always easy to park, must consider the size. Others have had problems with their Tundra. I am 64, owned many vehicles, there are some that have problems. That is not an overall picture of the new Tundra. My wife & I enjoy our Tundra very much. In fact we leave her 2008 Camry parked and take the road in the Tundra. The 4.7 has all the power needed for the average home owner. Heavy duty work go for the 5.7 and turn more heads.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a quirky habit of naming my vehicles, because I usually keep them for 10+ years. I call my Tundra truck Tunk. I like the way it feels when I'm driving, and the turning radius for this size vehicle is amazing. The seats are comfortable if you pull the headrests out & turn them around so you're not forced to scrunch your neck to conform. The 236 hp V6 is smooth as silk & purrs like a big cat when you're cruising down a back road at 55 or 60, up or down a hill, where it is lugging down below 2k rpm. The cruise control took a little getting used to because the control "schtick" turns with the wheel, while other levers remain stationary. Heat & A/C superb, back seats roomy & comfortable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love all of the storage spaces & the efficiency of the windshield wipers. The topside access to the oil filter and the dampened tailgate mechanism are pure genious. The rear seats, designed to flip up/out of the way, make cargo room, & are extended, roadtrip approved. The console is clever/useful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck may prove that Toyota's reputation for dependability is a thing of the past.

This was the first of many, many problems: stability control failed, my 9 year old pulled the door closed and broke it, tailgate jammed shut, windshield wiper broke, tire pressure sensor failed...all this in only 6 weeks of ownership.

<TEXT>I have had this truck for almost 3 months and 2,500 miles with no problems at all. The power and 6 speed transmission are perfect together. You really have to be careful on the highway because it is so quiet and smooth that when you're going 75-80, it feels like 55-60 (1,800 rpm at 70 mph) . The double cab has plenty of room for 2 car seats and the center console is big enough for a cooler. My gas mileage has been about 14-15 in mixed driving and around 18 on the highway. With the power you have, that isn't bad. I used to have a Dakota regular cab with the 4.7 and I get better gas mileage in the Tundra and have almost 150 more horsepower. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Toyota vehicle and I am impressed. I owned a Ford diesel 3/4 ton and pulled a fifthwheel camper with it, purchased my new Toyota for the same use. The Tundra with a 6 speed automatic pulls my camper with no problem. I was skeptical about the weight class of the tundra for pulling a fifthwheel with the weight of the camper at the pickups limits, but not anymore. This is a vehicle that is impressive to drive and feels very stable on the road with a load on it. The tow/haul mode does all the work for you and handles everything fine with the cruise control in use. Great gas mileage for a 4 wheel drive with 18 to 21.5 on the highway makes this truck a pleasure to drive.</TEXT>

I'm not a big truck guy but this thing is perfect for people looking for the convenience of a truck and the ride of a car. The truck is big so people need to be aware that parking can be tight.

<TEXT>This thing is like driving a jacked up sports car! It is a little strange to be in a vehicle this big that has so much power. Overall I am very impressed with all levels of this truck. The fit and finish is top notch, the doors shut with a tight seal, the bucket seats are great and it tows my 20' boat like it isn't even there. I traded my z71 suburban for the Tundra Doublecab. It has as much room in the back seat as my Burb had in the second row. Mine has the XSP package which includes the 20" BBS wheels, fender flares, leather, step bars, skid plate, etc. I think this must be a package that is only available from S.E. Toyota as I don't see it listed on here. Buy one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my slate metallic Crewmax for a little over a month now and it is a blast to drive. The engine and tranny are great. Impressive power with smooth shifts. I've never driven a vehicle with brakes this good. I've averaged almost 16 mpg in mixed driving and thats after putting 22" rims and slightly larger tires on it. I test drove every other 1/2 ton truck. Nothing else was close. Test drive a Tundra. You will buy it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm really enjoying this truck. The ride is very comfortable and the power of the 5.7 is fabulous. It is the quickest vehicle I have driven in years. There are a couple of annoyances, the seat belts chimes if not buckled and the doors lock automatically. The doors are too large. You need two parking spaces just to get them open. There is plenty of room behind the seat but it could be utilized better for instance hooks to hang bags on. The one clothes hook is behind the drivers seat which blocks your view and there isn't one on the other side which would be the better location. No vanity mirror for passenger. Interior plastics are low end looking. With all that said I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride quality and the "Get Up and GO" of the 5.7.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck replaced a F150 Lariat 5.4L 4x4, and there is no comparison. The Tundra has power to spare whether towing or just driving. It rides well, but not as smooth as the F150. Plenty of room inside for passengers, thermos bottles, and glove compartment type objects, but there is no place to store jumper cables or even basic tools. Little to no road noise and features are luxury. The traction control system is awesome for highway driving in 2WD on slick or wet roads. Mileage is better than expected: over 19 on the highway, 13 while towing, and 14.5 in the city. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, Power, Power! Plenty of interior passenger room. Fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ater doing the SUV thing we decided to look at a four door truck. After researching the other manufacturers, we decided to go with the Toyota. The 5.7 liter engine is amazingly powerful. We got the SR5 Crewmax X-SP package which gives you a lot of extras for the price of the truck. The interior comfort is amazing, I am 6'3 and have more than enough room in the front or rear of this truck. My wife loves this truck more than I do for the comfort and awesome looks that it has. Toyota gives you what you want with the Tundra, power, performance, comfort and reliability. If you don't get caught up with the power of the 5.7 you can get 20 mpg while driving. If you drive it you will buy it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We like it all. Well done.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Toyota truck, the first one was a 1992 4wd delux extended cab pickup. Yes it drives like a truck, but guess what... it's a truck. Great sound system, runs sooo smooth, and sounds awsome (TRD package). The power in the 5.7 V-8 is incredible! I took it the second week I owned it; it did just fine! I am happy with the purchase!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite feature would have to be the sliding rear window - what a cool idea!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I paper-compared all 5 full-size mfgs and narrowed down to Chevy and Toyota. Toyota still was the no-brainer. Why buy a 16 valve, push rod V8 with 315 HP when you can have 32 valves amd 381 HP. Also, rear disc brakes, 6 speed tranny and an interior big enough for hide-and-seek. The SR5 package, to me, rides like a Lexus. The 6 speed tranny is almost anticlimactic as it is so smooth: it feels like a 1 speed. This truck will turn tighter than my 1992 x- cab Tundra. Fuel mileage is dead-on 18 mpg as rated, however, I drive 28 mi of a 30 mile commute on the interstate. Even with the 4.30 rear diff. gears this truck turns only 1900 rpm at 70 mph.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth engine, tons of "giddy-up", handsome black interior, steering wheel radio and bluetooth controls, tons of storage bins/cupholders, excellent towing stability, excellent 4WD performance, quiet cabin at any speed, smooth tranny, looks, hydraulic tailgate, seats, interior room, stopping power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always driven Fords for work and play, but that just changed. This truck has more power, more tow capacity, the interior looks better, more room, plenty of storage inside cab for papers, cards, files, drinks (on the door also), turns better, and is just more fun to drive. I have driven just about every Ford truck there is up to 850s (work). This truck compares to the F250 5.4L Lariat in my book. I also love to race and this truck has it there, well for being full size!! We will see how it lasts and pretty quick. Almost ready for first oil change in about 1 1/2 months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first truck, having owned SUVs, but I talked with a lot of folks before going with the Tundra. Ride is excellent, fuel econmy great for its size (getting 19-20 hwy) - not an in town kind of truck though. Drives, handles and brakes well. Massive amount of room. Love the tow mirrors. Could use better back up lights, sonar should be standard in trucks this size. I still wish someone would market a small truck that would blow away the big boys on the highway in mpg. For now, there is no gain in going smaller if you want 4WD so why not get a big truck that can carry more (if you need a truck).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the 4WD EC Limited TRD 1 week ago. Only +/- 120 miles but so far very impressed. Researched all comparable trucks for 6 months before making purchase. Engine is a beast! Not as impressed with the 6 speed tranny as I expected. The 5 speed in our '05 Sequoia is smoother. However, truck is brand new so I may be overly sensitive given some reports of tranny issues I have read. Ride is a bit choppy with the TRD package but I think it will soften over time and the price ($105) with the Limited makes it a no-brainer. Topped off after 1st 1/2 tank of gas and calculated at 12.4 MPG with all driving in town. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this truck. I bought this truck in April and I drive it to work and trips and where ever I like to go. I love the look of the truck, I love driving the truck and I definitely feel safe in it, and confident that it won't break down. The interior however is so blahzo. I initially wanted a Ford F150, but the one I wanted with similar options was almost five thousand dollars more than the Toyota. The interior in the Ford felt more solid. I wish I would have gotten navigation and a moon roof. Other than that I would recommend this truck to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the look of this truck! I also love that I can fit my dad (6'2", 350 pounds) in the back seat! I also love that the back window rolls all the way down and I can plug my iPod right now into the stereo!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this truck after my F-150 proved untrustworthy. The Tundra rides very well, very quiet and the engine and transmission are incredibly smooth. It tows our 6500 lb trailer with ease. Not something I could say about our 5.4 L F-150. The brakes are outstanding. The acceleration and handling are fantastic. I haven't experinced the fabled 'bed bounce' even though I have tried to induce it on some washboard gravel roads. I have had it off pavement and the ride is still great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the finest truck I have ever driven. It's got power, style and it is pretty darn comfortable to drive. The MPG is fair, but it is expected for a big V8 truck. The interior is very roomy, has a zillion cup holders and a lot of storage. It did not come with a bed liner so I got the Line-X spray in for it. Love it. It gets a little bumpy at times with the bed empty, but so has every truck I ever had. </TEXT>

<TEXT>In terms of carrying capacity, this is the lightest duty truck I have ever owned. In terms of overall quality and versatility, it is the best. Toyota has overcome previous problems with ring gears, brakes, power and ergonomics and has produced a vehicle that would please even the most critical of those among us who actually expect a vehicle to do serious work. The 6 speed transmission is flawless. Brakes are superb. Interior comfort and ride is better than many cars. Acceleration is awesome. Towing capacity is 10,000 pounds plus, as advertised. Stable, safe, well put together. I now have 3500 tough miles on her and not a hint of a problem. Best truck I have ever owned. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The heated tow mirrors look good and function well. The double cab rear seat is comfortable, even for 6-footers. Toyota even thoughtfully included a restraint hook for infant car seats. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Gob-smacked happy with this brand new truck. The power/acceleration is sensational. Averaged 16.9 mpg on a playful 230 mile rural/highway drive. Love the engine sound, gauges, silky drivetrain, and smooth ride. Interior materials could be improved, human factors improvements needed (console cover hard to reach, extending to perform a lot of nav touch-screen data entry is discomforting to my back). Leather seats are comfortable but could be softer. Side view mirrors are sensational. Auto heat/AC feature works great, tailgate assist is nice, lifetime AT fluid (not convinced yet), JBL stereo sounds good. Overall, a very quiet and refined ride for such a powerful truck. Best half-ton ever made!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5.7L engine and 6-AT smoothness, looks of 20" wheels, view from side mirrors is the best ever, nav w/bluetooth hands-free telephone is a cool feature, JBL sound system rocks, steering wheel audio/telephone controls. Cold package is a good buy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Like everything about this truck except for one unfortunate issue. The six speed auto seems to randomly start vibrating as if going over a rumble strip. It feels like a torque converter issue. Picked up from dealer today after they evaluated it. They are going to replace the transmission which only has about 800 miles on it. What adds insult to injury is that they are replacing this with a rebuilt unit. I for one havent had real good luck with other rebuilt auto parts. Service said Toyota wouldnt let them order a new one. They had their crankshaft issue earlier this year now it appears the transmission may be an issue. This truck cost almost 50k!</TEXT>
