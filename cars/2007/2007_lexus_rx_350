<TEXT>I had an RX300 and LOVED it! Traded it for a new (at the time 2007) rx350 and its been a lemon from the start. Passenger seat broke twice..dealer wont fix again. Transmission slips (dealer said the car is "thinking" what gear it should be in) Tires wont align properly - 4 sets of tires in 2 years (Dealer said must be my driving), replaced battery, brakes (after 40k miles - seriously??. I NEVER had to do this on my RX300 nor the Volvo or BMW we have!! Electrical system is wacky - sometimes radio wont turn off unless you smack it. Most recently - back seatbelt wouldnt release my SMALL CHILD and had to call 911 for them to cut her out. I may have gotten a lemon - its true - but just be warned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got the RX 350 AWD new and so far has been great for what we use it for. It has been reliable with minimal issues that the dealership has taken care of. Not the most fun to drive as it is very plush and you really can't feel the road. It is just the right size for us and tows our 3500 lb boat just fine. Lately, @30k miles now, I've noticed the mileage isn't as good as it used to be. Not exactly sure why but it gets about 16-18 mpg combined. Few years ago, it got 24/25 mpg on highway. Great vehicle, would consider another one when the time comes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Lexus is a fair car but way overrated. The Navigational system does not allow the driver or passenger to make adjustments while the vehicle is in motion. Lexus refuses to acknowledge this design issue and stonewalls its customers...so much so that owners are talking about class action litigation. If you must buy this model year, shop around until you find one without the navi. The engine has high noise...sounds like a 1970's diesel. Lexus advises that it is due to their decision to go with a mechanical timing chain. I would rather have a quiet vehicle and pay the cost to replace. High wind noise at highway speeds. Buy an Acura, you will be much happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What can I say, it's a Lexus. Coming from my fingers, that's not a compliment. I'm not the primary driver, but when I do I can find nothing but criticism for it. I myself am a BMW person. I'd certainly rather drive my 1998 528i than this "station wagon." The suspension is horrible, there is no feel for the road -- it is very neutral and muted. Same thing for the steering wheel it is very soft with no feel whatsoever. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior layout isn't too bad, compared to say a GM or Ford product. The controls are very easy to use, no need to look for the manual. The HID lights are good -- but then again so is every other marque's stock HID lights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I replaced my beloved 4Runner with this and it's almost too nice a car for me. It drives great and is so quiet and comfortable it makes the ride more relaxing. I am very happy with the gas mileage, (20-28 mpg) and I agree that the sound system could be nicer. I have absolutely no rattles and love the leather, the moon roof and seats. My dealer is very accommodating and I couldn't be happier. I'm at 30K plus in mileage and my tires are holding up fine. I also love the headlights that turn with the wheels-the lights are so bright you could throw a party in front of your headlights! (not while driving, of course).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rear door lift button on the key and console, the seat adjustment memory, the seat heater and the sunroof is fairy quiet. I like the way the seats fold down, the little stuff-a first aid kit in the cargo area, free roadside assistance and towing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a 2000 ES 300 and purchased a RX 350 February, 2007.The RX has rattles everywhere. I have had the RX in the shop for over 18 days in the past 18 months. The noise and rattles are so loud you can hear them over the radio. The dealership has tried to eliminate the rattles, but they remain. The moonroof has been replaced, extra insulation added, etc. with no change. The engine noise is also very loud. The 2000 ES has over 100,000 miles and has never had a rattle, the wind noise is less and the ride and acceleration is much smoother. The ES also has more front leg room. I do not recommend this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I characterize the RX-350 as a luxury small SUV (most call it a medium size. With 270 hp it keeps the lead footers mostly pleased and for the more average to docile drivers the 26.8 mpg that I recorded on a 330 mile stint on interstate 10 on cruise control at 71 mph is EPA busting. On a 1040 mile trip I recorded an average of 25.8 mpg. Now mind you I never exceeded 75 mph on this trip, but for the economy fan, where else are you going with that kind of power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All in all I'm satisfied with it, 2nd Lexus I've owned, I can't decide whether I like it better than my 93 LS 400 though. The vehicle is so smooth that it kind of takes away from the driving experience. That and the blindspots are my only complaint. Also, the standard stereo is mediocre at best for a vehicle of this caliber. Definitely opt for the Mark Levinson system if possible. The exterior is classy and modern, the interior is gorgeous and ridiculously comfortable, and again it drives so smooth it's pretty much not "fun" to drive. That's good for some people I suppose.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Lexus (1998 ES 300) I drove 164,000 miles absolutly no problems. The Lexus 2007 RX 350 that replace it now has 27,850 and absolutly no problems. There is a pattern here. The quality, fit and finish are 1st rate. Yes, it costs a little more in the initial purchase price but you get it back many times over in reliability, comfort and safety. I am an engineer by profession and I am really picky.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took Delivery at the end of February. My ONLY regret was not getting the Nav system w/back up camera (hubby still insists it wasn't necessary). I just enjoy driving this vehicle. Will probably buy it at the end of the lease. Surprised by the good service center. Routine work was done quickly, but they still loaned me a car for my convenience. When my mom lost her hearing aid, they took out the seats to search, and when they finished they told me there was no charge. I was shocked, and now my mom is planning to buy a car from them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Perfect car to get from point A to point B. I wouldn't necessarily call it "fun to drive" but it definitely has some power underneath the hood. Interior quality is very good, and the standard power lift-gate is very convenient.

Our current set of tires is Goodyear and has less than 30% of the treadwear left. Our gas mileage is far better than the actual sticker. Close to 24 MPG in the city and 28 MPG on the highway!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My kids are grown and out of the house, and the RX 350 is perfect for my wife and me. We live in a hilly area in the Northeast and this vehicle is terrific in the snow. City mileage is 19, probably because of the hills, but the highway mileage is 27 to 29. I use regular gas and I don't see any dropoff in performance compared to the premium I've tried.

<TEXT>I've owned this vehicle for about a year now, and this is the best vehicle out there for the money. This is a luxury vehicle, not a high performance sports car. Lexus sets the bench mark and now every other cross-over SUV out there is making lookalikes. The cabin is very quiet and comfortable. The ride is smooth, not stiff like some other SUVs. Quality materials and craftmanship is very evident. This vehicle is heavier than your sedan, but it has lots of power for your thirst. Lexus really design this vehicle to not only satisfy your needs, but to pamper you. Also styling is top class, better than BMW X5 and or the Mercedes look. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a beautiful car and very comfortable to drive. It equipped with everything with quality built-in you can not get from other car manufacturers.

<TEXT>Althought the RX 350 has several things going for it, there are at least as many negatives. We were sold on the Lexus reputation for reliability, & so far it holds true. But the cabin isn't as roomy as we'd like for it to be. The car itself is too lightweight. At times I've had the steering feel as though it's being yanked out of my hand during sudden acceleration. No matter how I adjust the outside mirrors I still have huge blind spots. The cargo area has turned out to be so much less than we need. Max. seating for comfort - 4. I miss my Tahoe! </TEXT>

<TEXT>When you're going around the corner or taking off from a slow speed the car jerks into a lower gear and roars away. It doesn't shift smoothly into the next lower gear and smoothly drive away. It drives me crazy. The dealer "re-flashed" the computer and it didn't help much at all. If it's a problem then Lexus better fix it soon. I've already decided not to buy another even though I love the car otherwise. I may take a very much closer look at the new Toyota Tundra I'm about to buy also. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at many SUVs including X5 & 3, Q7, Volvo, etc. and figured this would be the best bang for the buck - it's a Lexus, it's gotta be good, right? This model seems to have issues. There is a rattle that appeared right away that comes from the steering column (or dash, not sure), interior quality is not great, brakes are spongy, etc. The dealer recognizes that the rattle noise is strange but played it down saying until Lexus Corp. says otherwise, the party line is that "this is normal". The new engine for the 350 is noisy, sounds like a decent diesel engine but this is a gas engine! I'm conflicted because I want to like it but at 800 miles I'm already thinking about selling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are very comfortable and the back seats are quite good - the reclining feature is nice. The ride is like a car, so generally you can drive long distances.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased this car as a replacement for our Honda Odyssey, which we thought was way too large for our family of 4. Fantastic build quality, fantastic engine, nice and high quality interior. The price for the nav is high, but it includes a lot of other goodies such as the HID lights, which are worth the extra expense. The price can exceed $45K quickly, but the RX 350 is one of the better deals out there. Great car for general use, but probably too small for an extended cross-country trip - the trunk and general passenger area are just too small. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at several models before deciding on the RX, my first SUV. It's a stylish vehicle, and the features have been great. I drive a lot and have moved as well, so the NAV has been priceless for ensuring I never get lost. It has great features I'm still discovering after several months such as being able to preview your route. I love the interior, though as a Jaguar owner, some things have been an adjustment such as the wiper system, and the fact that the seat does not retract when you get out, only the steering wheel. The rear seating is great, esp. the center console which has plenty of room for drinks and snacks for the kids, not the flimsy front of seat you find in some cars.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The NAV system is number one! Also comfortable seating. The bluetooth system works great (remember the speaker is above, not in the steering wheel!), backup camera. Use of NAV screen for most controls. Great interior, exterior colors. Handles well, easy to drive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>2007 RX 350 loaded. Traded down from a BMW X5 3.0 with 125,000 miles. I thought buying a Lexus would be a good choice since my BMW had a ton of miles on it and the Lexus was much cheaper. The saying is true, you get what you pay for. I've owned the Lexus for 3 weeks, 4 times in the shop. First a mirror, then the bluetooth (X2), and then the driver's seat. I weigh about 180 lbs (so its not me). This car is slow and sloppy. I will be trading it in as soon as get a little equity built up. Very disappointed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the RX after an extensive search and over three dozen test drives. The RX is best overall in reliability, safety (backup camera has already saved me a couple of minor bumps) and comfort for any family vehicle that I looked at. Any other car and I'd be giving up on one of the three. I got the Mark Levinson (as a result, the DVD as well, c'mon Lexus!) and it is awesome. The leather is very, very nice. Back seats are comfortable and recline. Rear gate can be opened and shut by remote, which is great during the school drop-off. Mileage has been around 16 around town which is not the best, but on our last 100 mile road trip, we got 28 mpg average on the highway. That's awesome! Congrats to Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great auto. This is second we have owned in the RX series. The AWD suspension is superior to the two wheel drive and was the reason for the upgrade. The ride is a bit stiff. This is OK for hard driving, but in normal driving you feel too many bumps. The navigation system is difficult for most to use, but the map feature is great and very helpful to see your way around a new area. This is a Lexus consequently all features work very well. The wind noise is excessive for a luxury vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 3 different SUVs: 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee LE / 2005 Mercedes M-Class / 2007 Lexus RX 350 (AWD). I must say that by far, I have enjoyed the Lexus the most. Like all SUV owners you are looking for a particular kind of car... one that is spacious, versatile, and luxurious. This vehicle (Lexus RX 350) has definitely been my top choice for all of these. Although this vehicle was for my wife, I will often sneak off with it instead of my M-Class. For those of you who can spend a little more for the "extras" (Mark Levinson SS, Rear DVD , Nav. System), I would definitely suggest getting them. You will never regret purchasing this vehicle! I know I don't and my wife LOVES IT!!!</TEXT>

Negatives: based upon the cost, beauty and name alone - this vehicle should come with a much better sound systems, softer leather seats, and among all things the rear backing feature (this feature is standard in the Nissan Murano) where you can view backing up without having the standard navigational system. I love Lexus vehicles, this is our 3rd lexus - first SUV. Would I trade it for something else??? NAWW.... Though the new Acura MDX did catch my eye!</TEXT>

It may not have the horsepower that other SUVs have, but Lexus is known not for power, but great interior and reliability. I've only had this car for 2 months, and I'm so happy! The nav is a little complicated, but very helpful. The voice recognition doesn't work very well, but I don't know of any cars with good voice recognition. I wouldn't suggest using the bluetooth with your cell phone; it is not very clear and I find myself hunched over and screaming at the steering wheel to be heard.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After selling our 01 RX 300, we leased an 07 RX 350 awd. Nice, classy looks with good comfort. Handling is improved with less body roll. Cabin is quiet, controls are easy to reach. Acceleration is very good and smooth. Like the 18" alloys, but low profile tires give up a little ride quality. Gas mileage has been poor. Averaged 20-23 with 3.0 and only getting 18-19 with 3.3. With few dealers, prices aren't as negotiable. Nice vehicle, but overpriced imo by 4-$6000.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife's vehicle, replacing her '02 RX 300. Positives include a far more powerful V6, with the guts the RX 300 lacked. Interior design is not as nicely appointed as the old one (Coach Edition). Steering is too low-geared, although the turning circle is improved over the RX 300. The handling exhibits too much sponginess, body roll, and understeer. The stereo is excellent, and the ride very smooth and quiet except for the annoying rattle in the dash! This, frankly, is very disappointing, as there is some rattle that appeared at about 5K miles, giving the impression of poor build quality, and not Lexus. Will have the dealer see what gives, but not encouraging in a new car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I decided to upgrade my 'flawless' 1998 Toyota 4-Runner, the RX 350 was a 'no-brainer'. A lot more luxurious, more class and good looks coupled with Toyota's solid reputation made the decision easy. Overall I like it. Ride, fuel-mileage, luxury are right up there. However, the Nav System that is 'voice-activated' comes up short. What really hurts however is that the 'RX' series doesn't include recognition of any 'Climate Commands'. All of the other Lexus models do. I called Lexus/USA about this. A 10 second download would fix the problem. Their answer - 'Sorry - No Deal'. It makes you feel that you have less of a Lexus than the other models. Why?? </TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2001 RX 300 and really enjoyed it. Passengers expressed how much they liked the interior and ride comfort. I upgraded to the 2007 RX 350 and it is a BIG improvement over the '01. No other SUV in this class can come close to the Lexus in driving dynamics and overall luxury and comfort. I can't wait for the ALL NEW 2009 RX!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've got about 1,000 miles on a Lexus RX 350 AWD. We were looking for a 5- passenger SUV. We looked at Volvo, Mercedes, BMW as well. Lexus had the best combination of space, easy to drive, power and luxury for us. We owned 2 Toyotas before - Sienna and Avalon - and thought both were great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my RX 350 for almost one month and just returned from a 1600 mile trip with my wife. We love the smooth and quiet riding and audio sound from the 6 disc mp3 cd changer. The voice command navigation is a plus and very helpful. Gas mileage is slightly below 24 mile/gallon on highway. Passing power is weak for a 270 horsepower vehicle but it is OK for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>More enjoyable than expected to drive. The pick-up power on highway is great. Rides well. Armrests and leather seats could be better. Negative is the lack of places/nooks for containing things - papers, pens, notepad, etc. the middle counsel quickly is used up and there are few additional utilization spaces. Woman designer needed for upfront interior space usage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a RX 300 for seven years. After test driving the RX 350, I bought it on the spot. I have only had it a month but just completed a 2500 mile trip. This is one of the best cars I ever owned. It averaged 27.5 MPG the first 800 miles then jumped to over 29 MPG at 70 MPH average. I didn't buy it for economy but it outperforms my PT Cruiser. The cabin is so quiet and the water repellent windows are unbelivable in a rainstorm. This is my wife's daily driver and she loves the liftgate feature and the comfortable seats. I'm 6'3" and I have plenty of room. This is by far the best in class overall. Lexus got this one PERFECT.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Whenever you hear about a Lexus, it's about how quiet the interiors are. The RX is not as quiet as the Lexus sedans and not as isolated, but is still very refined. Yet, all the salesmen say, "Look how quiet." Blah. The engine growls under acceleration unlike the new ES or GS, but it is a classy rumble. The car is a magnificent touring vehicle and should be considered if you're looking at MBZ and Caddy crossovers. Be sure to test drive the vehicle at 75-80 MPH or you will be stunned at the road and wind noise on the drive home. The navigation system is excellent and knows when you are making illegal U turns.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The best compared to all other SUVs this size. Ride is great. But some serious features are lacking for somthing this pricey. I use hands free a lot and compraed to BMW and MB, the bluetooth features are at least one generation behind and need upgrading. Cannot dynamically download your cell phone's phone book, have to register one contact at a time into the car's phone book which is a security risk, no way to add pause, wait etc to phone numbers. Have to add maintenance schedule manually, no self diagnosis as in other imports.</TEXT>

I will be purchasing another RX 350 very soon, unless the new LS 600h stickers for less than 70 grand!! HA HA!! Anyway, if you're out there trying to decide on a new luxury ride, the RX 350 is your best bet!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were looking at the IS. Then switched to the ES/ GS but purchased RX 350 two months ago and love it more than when new. They have thought of almost everything. Comfy, confident, responsive (18" wheels), quiet ride allows you to sit back, relax and have fun driving. Everything you need is within reach. Navigation is a great help. Able to carry a lot - full sized sofa, small freezer, 5 people comfortably. Styling is acceptable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, navigation, backup camera, comfort, quiet, smooth ride, all those air bags. Lots of storage areas. Reliability and dealer are the best. Other than suggested improvements, an ideal vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked my RX 350 last month from the dealership. I drove over 400 miles to get it home. Every thing about it is just perfect. Light but reponsive steering, this unit is front wheel drive so I have no idea how it will perform in the winter. The look is sleek and fun the drive smooth and fun. Did I say this is a fun ride, I think I did. I want to get my wife one next. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My mistake was test-driving a used RX 330, which prompted me to go to a Lexus dealer to check out a new one. My mistake! The '07 RX 350 has enough added zip to eliminate any doubts that this may be the perfect car. Smooth, silky ride with more than enough power when you need it. Everything you might think of as a "wouldn't it be nice?" option has been thought of and tastefully designed in the car. Every detail is perfect. It is truly an amazing vehicle. I was not one who fell in love with my car... until now. As I said: don't drive one. You'll have to buy it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went searching for the safest vehicle I could find. This was pretty much it. It also happens to be about the quietest, smoothest ride I found. If there's a downside, it's that it's so quiet driving along at freeway speed, it's easy to let your mind wander. Doesn't hit 20 mpg though, and with premium fuel, expect 50-60 dollar fillups. But that's a small price to pay for one of the best vehicles on the road. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my new RX 350 a few weeks ago and this is one amazing SUV. I had the RX 300 a few years ago and the worst thing that I could have done was trade it in for something sub- par. I've had everything from Acura to Audi, Infiniti to Volvo and nothing compares to this SUV. The ride and the cabin are so quiet and smooth as silk. If you are in the market for a new SUV that will make the neighbors jealous park this baby in your driveway and watch what happens. These are my opinions and I purchased this car based on my needs and likes, but again this SUV is simply amazing. I would definitely add this to your line up of test drives.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Once you drive it you will have a hard time not buying it. It is quiet, luxurious, and fun to drive. The fifth generation navigation system is impressive and more accurate than expected. Little features like the outside mirrors moving down and the rear camera display on the navigation system so that you can see better backing up are very helpful. The people at the dealership were friendly and helpful. Although buying a car is always stressful, they reduced the stress as much as possible. I also intend to take advantage of the lifetime tire replacements and free car washes. I intend to keep this car for some time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation system is great. I also like the high intensity headlights and the way the turn to light up the way when rounding a turn.</FAVORITE>
