<TEXT>Have had the vehicle 2 years. Absolutely no problems with anything. Put gas in the car and drive with oil changes every 5000 miles. Not a creak, groan or rattle. Very happy with everything that I use the car for. Its comfortable with great gas mileage consistently in the low 30's with mixed driving. Best so far has been 39.8mpg on a 700 mile drive to Washington state. Would certainly recommend to anyone who wants a solid, dependable, reliable, comfortable car who has an aversion to dealers workshops!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable, quiet, solidly built. Gauges in blue backlight and the sound system is better than my other car costing $10,000 more!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was skeptical about buying a Hyundai at first based on past reputation, but I'm definitely sold on them now. Great amount of features for the price you pay. The manual transmission makes it fairly sporty to drive, and I'm averaging a solid 30 mpg in mixed driving. Plenty of room on the inside, spacious trunk. Have only had one minor issue that was fixed quickly under warranty, other than that no problems whatsoever. My only other minor complaint is I wish the gearing was such that the rpm's on the freeway would come down a bit - at 70 mph it's at about 3000 rpm, which is a tad noisy. It's not bothersome though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a follow up with my earlier post on my initial purchase. I have now logged 18,000 miles after 1 year and 2 months. I have not had any mechanical problems and I have not had any part on this car break on me. I am getting a solid 25-27 mpg in city and 33-36 mpg on the highway. I have installed various after market devices and still have not had any electrical problems. Although the car can use an extra 20-30 hp for passing, but still acceleration is adequate. Air conditioning gets the job done, even during 100 degree summer temps. After driving this car for over a year I would recommend this car for people that want a car that is good on gas, comfortable and great for a commuter.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall the car is great! Excellent mileage, though a better engine and tranny could really get u going, great for commute/long distance. Plenty of leg space. For a $12k car, you can't go wrong! Forget about trading it in after 4 years!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The manual tranny and engine could be improved, take off sluggish, plenty of trunk space </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My used 2007 Hyundai Elantra is ok. It's a very practical car but I've had to replace my air conditioner 3 times in 2 weeks. My headlight froze and fell out in a -35 Celsius day in Alberta. And Hyundai says it's over abuse on the car! Plus I've only had this car for 3 weeks. It was a former rental from Avis. This car is bad except the looks and fuel economy. DO NOT BUY A HYUNDAI ELANTRA!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We get 29-32 mpg even w a lead foot! I still see Elantras on the road & think what a pretty car-oh it's like mine! I still enjoy looking outside & seeing my shiny red car in the drive. The interior room is great compared to others in this class, although I agree that the plastic could use an upgrade on the door panels. The trunk is huge. It rides great, but we had to switch out tires as the original ones were death-traps on snow. But now it hauls through the slush and though it slides a bit, I haven't gone off the road yet (my friend in a Subaru Outback has 2xs this yr!) I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it. It's a great car for the price-we got ours used-it was a rental.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the last year, I have been the excited owner of this remarkable economy car. Driving this vehicle is an absolute pleasure as it is very comfortable, quick, and excellent on gas. I have taken several road trips including a 3000-mile round trip to Arizona and have never been more comfortable in a vehicle, especially not one of this size. The dashboard layout is impeccable and the lights are beautiful. The engine noise is minimal and returns fantastic performance, even while climbing 6% mountain grades in northern AZ. With 48,000 miles, this car gives me great reason to expect several more years of reliability and and pleasurable driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this car for our 15 year old daughter. Since she is a beginning driver, we wanted something that?s safe, easy to drive, with all the bells and whistles for under $20k. We?re impressed with the handling, gas mileage, interior features and space, and warranty. However, it is a bit noisy. Overall the Elantra is a great value for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has a 3.8 24valve overhead engine. We have kept the display for mileage on over a 3,000 mile period of time and have averaged 27.9 mi per gal. The space for hauling is amazing. We hauled two oak doors in it with the back seats folded down. It has lots of snap, very easy to handle, great to see out of and a very comfortable ride with great lumbar support. Love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I never thought I would buy an Elantra, but this car won me over. The combination of sportiness, quiet cabin, spaciousness, and very sharp interior and exterior made me walk away from the Camry and the Sentra. I still can't believe what a comfy ride I own.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I also purchased a 2007 Elantra, on 2/19/2007, and within 2 days I noticed that vehicles, even U-Hauls were passing me, so to stay with traffic, the speedometer was showing 85mph on the Interstate. I purposely drove by a stationary radar unit in a 45mph zone, going with the flow of traffic, the radar indicated 45mph, speedometer indicated 55mph. I contacted the Service Manager at the Dealer, and he said that he is having alot of complaints about this, and that I should bring it in, so he could get the part number off the speedometer, so they could order a new "cluster".</TEXT>

<TEXT>PLEASE be careful when purchasing this vehicle. I am a long-time Hyundai owner, previously owning a Sonata. I recently purchase a brand new 2007 Elantra. I have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it. A week after the purchase the transmission was acting up, jerking and stalling. The service department said it was a manufacturing defect in the seal. A week later now, STILL having major transmission problems, and still stalling. Also, the left turn signal won't cancel and the service department said it worked find. I am truly disappointed in this vehicle and regret buying another Hyundai. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd new Hyundai Elantra I have purchsed(also 2000 GLS and 2003 GT). We still have the 2003 and it has not given us ANY trouble, 82000+ miles. My new 2007 GLS with the 5 speed manual is more than I expected. I got combined city/highway mpg of 29, the numbers do not lie. The car seems so much larger than my '03. It handles and rides like a dream. Other than getting some rims and the windows tinted, I can not think of anything I would do to my new car. Hyundai is on par with any Civic and smokes the Corolla. If you do not test drive a Hyundai during your car search then you are doing your self an injustice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the car in jan. 2007, it has 1.500 kms, and I am wondering if the car has front suspension at all... Very noisy in irregular road, the front tren and the direction are causing knockings I am not very happy with...feels like driving a 100.000 kms used car. Further, the audio is poor and in the highway very noisy ( wind )</TEXT>

<TEXT> What an awesome compact! The car drives almost like a compact sport sedan. Handling is secure, and ride and comfort of this vehicle is amazing. I've had all different makes and models of compacts, but this car with it's extensive list of standard features and safety ratings as well as the quietness and overall perfromance is my best vehicle yet. And all at a very reasonable price! It really seems like your in a much more expensive compact! I would highly recommend this compact over many others, and it's really worth your while to give this car serious consideration before buying another compact.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stlying is great! Also handling and engine performance is very good. I really like the cars nimble road manners and the comfortable ride. The car is fiercely quiet and the interior fit and qualtiy is up there with more expensive sedans. Excellant overall build quality and exterior fit and finish!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After looking at the Mazda 3, Civic, and Corolla we went with the Elantra. The interior size, ride and features available with the Limited could not be met by the other three. Closest was the Mazda but it was smaller and the Corola and Civic didn't offer leather and heated seats, which have been greatly appreciated. Add in the outstanding warranty and safety features and it became obvious to us which was the car of preference.</TEXT>

<TEXT>you will have to spend 8k to 20k more to find a car with this many features gas mileage and quality. If this is any indication of cars to come from hyundai, Toyota and Honda are in serious trouble. HYUNDAI doesn't even advertise the fact that on the sun and sound package you get a tape cassette player along with the 6 cd changer. Now I am enjoying my music from the 60's,70's &80's. The 07 Elantra is an "out the park home run". Interior and exterior chrome accents, two tone interior "leather", blue back lit instruments, green lit gear indicator, and awsome laid out console make you feel like you are in style and luxury. I'm amazed at the smooth effortless power you get from it's 4 cylinder.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>heated leather front seats, interior color options you won't find on the so called comp,s. The tape cassette player. The 5 storage compartments with doors including glove box. roominess, trunk space no more vans for me!. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car. I have reviewed: Sentra, Corolla, and Civic. But I came to buy Elantra for its value overall. I bought '07 Elantra GLS + Preferred Package + Automatic for only $13,000. The other cars don't even come close to that price. The car is well made and its safety features are far above the competitors. The car drives well, it is comfortable, it is roomy (bigger than my old Galant '98). My wife just loves the car. Thank you, Hyundai and keep up the good work.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looking for better gas mileage on our daily commute, we downsized from a 99 Lexus ES-300 to the Elantra, and we don't feel deprived at all. We test drove the Nissan Altima and Honda Accord and Civic, Subarus and also the Sonata, but we ended up buying the Elantra 4DR SE (with sunroof) because of the interior roominess, comfortable ride, excellent handling, braking and acceleration. Not to mention that all of the safety features are standard. We've put 500 miles on the car in 2 weeks and are getting an average of 28 MPG or so in mixed city and HWY driving (at 65-70) with lots of hills. This car is a great value with a comfortable ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought the 2007 model in Carobon Gray and I love it. It's fun and comfortable to drive. At first a little sluggish, but now it's moving really well. Hyundai said it learns how you drive so around 1,000 miles it pickes up more speed! MPG could be a little better, but very attractive exterior and interior, very roomy, and a nice price!!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The blue lighted dash and silver accents! Pretty much everything, they did an excellent job on this new 2007 model. Very happy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 Elantra in December. I don't have a lot of miles on it yet, but so far I love it. I have been looking for other 2007 Elantras on the road but so far I haven't seen any. I am not sure why that is. I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a great mid-size sedan for under $20,000. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the new larger size and the curvy exterior design for 2007. The engine is so quiet and the ride so smooth, I find myself speeding because I don't realize how fast I am going. I like the blue interior lights, large trunk, multiple airbags, the warranty and the free roadside service.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car has been great so far, it drives very smoothly, and the handling is great. Braking with this car feels very solid and controlled too, it doesn't dip much in the front. When the car idles, the engine is very quiet. The small dimensions of this car also makes manuvering in parking lots quite easy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Definitely the awesome blue lights. I love driving this vehicle at night. The view out the front is great too. Very convenient steering wheel controls. The seats in the back are very soft and cushioned. The extra cup holders on the front doors are very convenient.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Best thing about this car isn't the price (which is awesome), its that its bigger than some midsize sedans (in fact its bigger than most midsized sedans of the 90s), yet competes with the compacts of the world(mazda3, civic, corolla, etc). You get so much more (standard features, warranty) for so much less money, what's not to like? The corolla is so outdated, the civic is great but honda dealers are way too proud of this overpriced car (as they don't like to come off sticker), the mazda is a good price but you still get so much more with the elantra. Hyundai has come a long way since the 90s, just try one out for yourself.</TEXT>

<TEXT>just upgraded from the 2004 model. I find myself driving faster I assume its because the ride is smoother and quieter. The increased leg room and wheel size is nice. Its fun to drive and has a good sound system. Probably better to wait till they really start the rebates to buy this car. You cant see as much of the hood/front end on the car as in previous years.</TEXT>

From a safty standpoint alone where else can you get a car with 4 wheel disc breaks, abs,electronic break force distribution, AND 6 (yes thats six!) standard airbags for under 15 grand? Not to mention all the other standard goodies included, the excellent fuel economy, super low emessions, power everything, outstanding warranty, and all built to great quality. Hyundai has come a long way and has come to par with the Japanese automakers. The old public perception will still keep resale values down but that is the only knock as far as Im concerened.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although I just bought the vehicle, I can tell that it is a good choice. Unlike some suggestions, it felt very stable on the road at speeds over 90 MPH. The standard features and looks are great, as is the price.Add all this to the warranty, and you'll find yourself getting a great deal.Compared to competition, Hyundai offers more for a reasonable price. Compared to the Corolla, it has better looks, options, and is more sophisticated. Compared to the Mazda3, it is a smoother ride and also has more options to offer. Finally, I found the Civic quite pricy and the looks on the Elantra are better. Add all this to better safety features and warranty, and you'll find that this is a good choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a small, well equipped, commuter car with good gas mileage. I also considered the Honda Civic LX & Mazda M3 I-Touring. If you want style and performance get the Mazda. Excellent long term reputation and a name brand, buy the Civic. For me the M3 was too too small inside and not as comfortable. The Civic was at least $2000 more with fewer standard features and has questionable interior styling. The Elantra is very comfortable, quiet, has fine performance for a small commuter and the warranty far surpasses the other two. With side curtain airbags and four wheel ABS disc brakes it is a leader in safety. Time will tell for long term quality but the longer warranty mitigates this risk.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have owned a 2007 Elantra GLS since Oct, 2006. So far, we are delighted with this car; it has an unrivaled value/price ratio. Its fuel economy is impressive: 28/36 mpg (8.4/6 l/100 km) city/hwy. According to the EPA 2007 Fuel Economy Guide, the Elantra is 2nd among non-hybrid mid-size cars. We love our Elantra because it handles great, it's *roomy* and exquisitely appointed. The car is very quiet, though engine noise is evident at high speeds (>75 mph/120 km/h). On the highway, our 5-spd handles just like an automatic: we can cruise/pass without down-shifting! The Elantra is a high-quality, affordable, fuel-efficient car with lots of features and all-around good performance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. Quality - this car is refined and well designed 2. Fuel economy 3. Safety - 6 air bags standard 4. Interior/trunk/rear seat space 5. Lots of storage compartments 6. Pull-down cup-holder in the rear seat 7. 5-yr bumper-to-bumper warranty</FAVORITE>

The automatic shifter is really cool. I purchased the premium package with the sunroof. 1st one sold in my state. Lots of heads turn as I drive by. the car has some cool lines, and the blue lights in the dash are easy on the eye and very appealing. The styling and features are better than that of the Sonata.

Interior with all the blue lighting is awesome. Standard features are great too (with prefered package on GLS model)! It drives very smooth, very smooth, Its easy to be going faster than you think you are. 70 on the highway with low noise. test drove 06 Civic, 07 mazda3, 06 Chevy cobalt, and a few others, and there is no doubt in my mind that I bought the wrong vehicle!

<TEXT>On Oct 10th my fiance and I were in a car accident that totaled our 2004 Hyundai Elantra. Everyone was fine thanks in part to how safe the vehicle itself was! Now on Oct 18th, after looking at many different cars and dealerships, we ended up going back to the guys who sold us the '04 and buying an '07. My first impression of the '07 was how well it handled. I'm able to turn corners sharper than before and my acceleration is amazing compared to anything else I've driven. The trunk space is amazing (though you wouldn't think so from the outside!) The small details are great a purse/trash holder in front is neat!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very large trunk space. "Best interior space of it's class" - it's not lying :) The water deflection on the sides of the doors is a great idea! The turning radius is another feature that I love in this car (even compared to the '04 version!)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is an excellent little car! This car drives nicer than the corolla and civic and handles great. Very comfortable. The fuel economy is not as good as I had hoped. I get 25 around town a lot of stop and go. It is very fun to drive and has a great little sound system. I like the mp3 aux jack. Drive this car before you decide to pay more for another model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I read where the 2008 Hyundai's are having a stalling problem due to faulty fuel pump design. I want to include the 2007 Hyundais in the mix. Our car was less than 60 days old when it died on the interstate and my wife was nearly creamed by a semi-truck. She now after reading about the fuel pump problems refuses to drive this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>27000 miles in the first 11 mos of ownership with absolutely 0 major problems. 33 mpg with 70% hwy, 30% city. Love all of the standard features for the price. If you buy, plan on keeping it forever, they don't hold resale at all! Only complaints are interior fit and finish, this thing is a rattle box.Rattles have formed from everywhere; glove box, doors, overhead trim and gauge cluster all rattle or squeak. Could benefit from a 5 speed tranny,seems sluggish/bogged down unless you get on it. All in all though it would be hard to find a better car for the money. As long as reliability stays I will be a happy camper. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I would be downgrading from my Santa Fe to the Elantra, but I love this car. With gas prices the way they are, I love averaging 30-32 mpg (mostly highway driving at 80mph). I even managed 42 mpg with a strong tailwind. Going from a V8 to V6 to a 4-cyl, I am impressed with its power. I could not have asked for a better price in a car that includes leather heated seats, 6 CD changer and MP3 jack. I hear the seats in the back are extremely comfortable and there is plenty of leg room. The trunk can handle a 40" diameter folding table. A less bumpy ride would be nice, but it is tolerable. It has been very reliable. I would not want to be doing my 24k miles a year in anything else.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace a 2003 Elantra GT 5 door, which was a good car. It was a pretty good car until I was in an accident 10 months after purchasing it. I was hit head on and the drivers airbag did not deploy when it should have. At least the seat belt worked. I contacted Hyundai about the airbags not deploying. Hyundai didn't seem to care. Since the Elantra depreciated quite a bit in 10 months, I got a disappointing check from the insurance company after my car was totaled. I went out and bought a Mazda 3. which was my 2nd choice. Hyundai has standard airbags in their cars, but I guess the deployment of the airbags is optional. Thanks Hyundai, but no thanks...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went into the dealership to try the Nissan Versa and Sentra, Honda civic, Mazda 3 and Scion tc. At the end of the day I test drove the 2007 Hyundai elantra se which was the 3rd manual car I have ever driven in my life and I instantly fell in love. So easy to drive compared to the acura I learned on, I got it down in 5 minutes and had to have the car. It feels like a sports car. The interior is massive compared to everything else. So much room and comfort, definitely feels more expensive than it was. I've had it for a month now and drive about 30 miles a day and never want to get out of it. Only problem is that gas mileage over speeds of 55 mph is 32 so actual highway mpg (at 70 mph) is off</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 Hyundai Elantra to replace my 1997 Chevy Malibu LS car. My Elantra's engine actually has more power than the 3.1 liter V6 engine in the Chevy Malibu regardless if I'm doing city driving or highway driving. The 2007 Elantra has virtually no engine noise and absolutely no road or wind noise whatsoever even when traveling at highway speeds. The headrests on the front seats can be adjusted to provide neck support just like the 2008 Nissan Versa's chair height front seats do. The horn sounds like one from a large semi truck. The trunk space is massive. I haven't had the vehicle long enough to test reliability.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Elantra is perfect for shuttling our four kids around to school and sports functions. We are getting about 28-29 miles per gallon in mixed driving. As many reviewers point out, this car does not give you a nice smooth ride, and is easily blown all over the road by high winds, but I think that is to be expected by cars this size. It does however handle well. I experience some annoyingly long gear shifts in the automatic transmission but it is still rather responsive little engine. After 1 year of ownership with heavy use I recommend this car. Only problem experienced so far was with a light in the driver side sun visor.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 10000 miles, the ride has been smooth, and the features have been pleasant. The dealership I go to is very friendly, but they deal in a variety of manufacturers, and have many returning customers. I haven't had any significant problems, yet. The driver's window squeals, and the glove compartment rattles, but the interior is wonderful otherwise. The manual transmission does not hold reverse very well, and will grind out from time to time. Downshifting into first at very low speeds can be hard sometimes as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall Very Good VALUE for the $ compared to Corolla and Civic, 2-3 grand less. Was about to buy Corolla, but Elantra BLEW it away. Looks better and is LARGER & SAFER than both. After driving over 6k miles and 6 months, here's the COMPLETE deal below. Too many reviews have the good, but not the BAD---and there are some! Dealership service HORRENDOUS & sales person was big liar. Medium bumps a bit harsh, mileage no way near claim, closer to 28-30 local/city combo, quick accelerating bit loud but quiets out. Side mirrors nice & big, but too big when parallel parking. BUT GOOD FAR outweighs the bad. It's simply the BEST value for $ no doubt! Watch out Toyota & Honda! Why pay more for less?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GREAT looking exterior, QUIET & STABLE ride, high fidelity stereo, top crash/safety ratings,6 airbags,comfy dashboard blue lights neat at nite.

It can seat 4 adult males and not have the unlucky ones in the back seat feel like they are in a penalty box. I average 28.5 combined and best ever highway mileage was 32.76 loaded to the gills. If you have a great deal of stop and go traffic in your commute I would suggest the auto transmission. Buy it, and then drive it for 10 years and then sell it for $2,500.00 .

The accessory outlet is handy, but the steering wheel audio controls are the best! Cruise control is precise. Trunk space is good with drop-down seats for added length. Good leg-room in rear seat.

Just before I had decided between the two, Hyundai came out with the New 2007 model for their Elantra. It looked very similar to the Civic, but it was signifiantly cheaper.

I used to have a 2005 Scion xA, and I think I'm getting the same fuel economy with a bigger vehicle.

Great style lines! So many great standard features - full of airbags, great entry stereo, easy to use controls that light up with a dynamic blue glow at night. Fun to drive. Dealer gave a great price - I did the research. Personally, I like the style better than the Sonata!! Remember, I did not expect a BMW quality line for this price.

<TEXT>I did extensive research and while there are cars in its class which have more style, more power, more reliability, more cargo room, more mpg, and get u more pats on the back, the Elantra scores high enough for me in all the categories above, but it comes in at 100's to 1000's of dollars cheaper than others in its class. Only 1400 miles on it, so my reliability rating is just my expectation based on last gen's Elantra's. The 132 hp is more than ample for everyday driving. Engine and cabin is fairly peaceful when cruising above the spd limit, but potholes can ruin that peace easily. A speedometer issue was fixed for free. MPG avg still only 27 in mixed hwy/city driving.</TEXT>

I own a 2006 Azera and have developed an affinity for Hyundai products as a result of my experience with both of these cars. While not perfect (what car is?), this car is way more upscale than its price tag. With incentives because Hyundai wanted to sell more PZEV models in CA, loaded (sun and surf package added) this car was under $17.4K. XM, high-end Infinity sound system, and heated leather seats make my commute way more comfortable.

There are always going to be things that the others do better, but Hyundai caught on that it's the extras that matter. I have the same extras as the SE, but without the 6CD changer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The natural warranty at no extra cost, including 5yr/60000 bumper to bumper (besides the 10yr/100000 drive train). The look and feel of the inside (my husband is 6'6" and he has full leg room to actually stretch out!). And it feels relatively safe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Civic performs better and that is it. Safety, quality, interior, leg room, and really every feature other than performance belongs to the Elantra so for me the choice was easy. I don't need to race this car, I have my 9 second quarter mile Camaro for that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 07 Elantra, is interior and handling is amazing, I drive all over and it's fun to drive. My wife owns an 01 Elantra and the improvements over the models are noticable sitting next to each other. I bought the manual, and it takes a second to get used to but the 07 is very refined compaired to the 01 manual. The Elantra is a very powerful car and for the size of the car. And the gas mileage can not be beat, with 328 miles to the tank, I go two plus weeks on one tank. This Elantra will be with me for a long time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the black interior and the feel of the clutch. I love the controls on the steering wheel and how high you sit in the car. Compared to my wife's 01 Elantra, I feel in hers I'm a inch or so off the ground.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the Elantra SE in carbon gray. I knew nothing of Hyundais prior to this purchase. I didn't even know anyone who owned one. I wanted something small with good mileage with all the nifty stuff I hadn't opted for (okay - couldn't afford) in my previous car. This one beat the Corolla and the Civic hands down in value. I've had it 3 months and it is just plain fun to drive. I only drive it to a commuter lot 4 miles from home and I wish I got to drive it further.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went to the dealership in hopes of grabbing the Mazda3 i-Sport, that is until I stumbled upon this cute, stylish, sporty little Hyundai. I test drove the i-Sport & several other cars in it's class & I know I made the right decision. I am thrilled about all the bells & whistles that are "standard" with this car: curtain airbags, anti- lock brakes, power windows & locks... I have a 7 month old & I feel confident that he is safe while we are driving around town. I actually look forward to my commute to & from work! This is my first car & I've only had it for a week- I absolutely love my Elantra! My boyfriend drives a Lexus GS300 & he wants to drive my car over his!!</TEXT>

We didn't like the 2006 model but the 2007 model is great! Very snappy and fun to drive. I really like the elantras before and this just made me a life time customer.

<TEXT>I was always one to stick with domestics like chevy, saturn, and pontiac...But after buying my new black with tan leather seats Elantra Limited, I am a true believer now. On top of the insane warrantee, the car comes fully loaded with all the fun features and 6 airbargs plus a 5 STAR crash test rating. The ride is very smooth and the engine is really quiet. There is hardly any road noise, at least when compared to the civic and corolla, and the interior looks and feels high quality. The stereo is my favorite part because it sounds like I'm inside of a mini-club when I'm driving home from work. And according to the thing next to the speedometer, I'm averaging 34.5 MPG and thats always nice!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the car for about three months now and I am very satisfied with my purchase. My family owns two huyndais and they have been good reliable cars so far. I thought the previous elantras were kind of ugly but this year the design is very appealing, which is why i went for it. For the money I think you get a great deal considering the safety options etc. My main complaint with this car is the speedometer. It is way off and it is a common thing if you read the forum here. Huyndai needs to take responsibility over this and get it fixed. 4-10% error cannot be ignored.I have yet to test my odometer-keeping my fingers crossed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife had a 2002 Hyundai Elantra which started falling apart. We decided instead of paying costly repairs we would buy a new one. First we looked into the Toyota Yaris and Corolla..We really didn't care for either of them. We then test drove a Nissan Sentra which seemed great but the price was a bit higher than we were wanting to pay. We decided to give Hyundai a shot again. We test drove the "new" elantra and fell in love with it. We choose the purple color but really it should be called Black Cherry. This car was for my wife and she is very happy with it! Best price and warranty out there for a small car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a long-time Hyundai owner. I like the body style, the comfort of the seats and the design of the interior. Additionally, the ultimate performance of the vehicle is better than prior models and the engine has more power. However, the manual transmission is difficult, to say the least, and I have driven a manual since I started driving. The friction point is hard to hit and the shifting is not smooth. Additionally the reverse is located in the same spot as 1st and does not easily come out of reverse to be put into first gear. Also, if you try to replace the stock stereo it's almost impossible to find a wiring harness; I ultimately had to have one shipped from New York to California.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Me and my significant other have already put 5K miles on our Seattle Blue Limited with light gray leather. He fight each other over who gets to drive it. I like the looks of the old Elentra but this version is incredible. The Mazda3 Grand Touring is nice and perhaps more handsome but basically costs 5K more with inferior gas mileage. So it's not even close IMHO. The 4c is peppy, climbs hills easily. 5 spd better than auto. The rear end sits up high so rear visibility is not good. But other than that, it's a great, great car. There are a few little things I wish it had, (see below) but I venture to say this is the best bargain of all cars, all cars, sold in the United States right now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the drive of the Elantra and so far the mileage is great. Be careful when washing the car you don't want to apply too much pressure or you will dent your car. The interior is extremely comfortable but I have to go to the service dept this week to get the seat belt adjusting piece fixed,it's stuck and the sunglass holder is broken and I've never even used it. I have made more trips back to the dealer than I've ever had to with a car. I previously owned a Tucson and I never had a single problem so I thought I would get the same quality with the Elantra. I hope nothing else breaks. It's fun to drive, handles nice but the cheap parts are cheap...I still prefer it over a Toyota or Honda</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were just minutes away from buying a 2007 Toyota Corolla S and we walked onto the Hyundai lot; everything changed. What caught my eye was a sporty little blue car that we thought looked like a Jetta, only nicer. We found the courage to walk into Hyundai territory, only to find the best small car on the market today, the 2007 Hyundai Elantra. When you add up the list of standard features with the SULEV rating, MPG, XM radio and outright fun of ride and drive; it was no contest. The Corolla was off the table and staying off the road. We bought a small car because gas prices continue to rise; the excitment of it all ended right there. To our supprise, this car Rocks!!!Yes a Hyundai</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car as a replacement for my Honda Accord LX. Even though its technically a smaller car it feels just as roomy inside. When buying this car I considered the Civic and Sentra as well but this car beat them both on features and price. Neither Honda or Nissan could match the feature set that the Elantra Limited offered and it was at least $2500 cheaper than the high end models of the Civic and Sentra. For me I had to have a car with heated seats and with other manufacturers I had to go to a larger model with high end trim to get that so it was an easy choice to go for the Elantra Limited. Only bad thing I can say is the cabin is a little noisy if the road isnt real smooth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car after reviewing Mazda, Toyota, Nissan and Honda. We test drove the Elantra and the Civic and after careful consideration of interior size, safety features and performance, we chose the Elantra. We love the Elantra. We received better performace and interior space than the Civic and just as quiet a ride for much less money. Gas milage has been around 26 - 27 in all city driving. It is also very fun to drive with crisp handling and excellent breaks. I could not find a vehicle with all the features of the Elantra for $3000 to $4000 more than I paid. If you are looking for a car in the compact to mid- size sedan class, you must test drive an Elantra.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Dumped gas hog SUV for 2007 Elantra. Wow, why did I wait so long. First several tanks averaged 33 mpg in mixed driving. And what a fun car to drive. Great on the highway (cruises smoothly at 75+ with no noise or discomfort). Around town has plenty of power, much more than I expected after driving V6 or V8 SUV's for years. Interior has plenty of room for family of 4 and the trunk is huge. It is amazing that Hyundai can cram this much usable space into such a small vehicle. And it has a tremendous list of standard features for such an inexpensive vehicle ($14K purchase price). I went looking for a gas saving small vehicle and found a great driving family car - what a pleasant surprise</TEXT>

<TEXT>With gas going up on top of having to maintain a C55AMG, I said, "phooey" on cars and got something practical. Practical, yes, but quite the fun "be boppin around ride".

My benz gets 19mpg, my Elantra gets almost 40 on the freeway. Hmmm, somebody do the math here but, a $200/mo. car payment, with lower maintenance costs (if any) and gas mileage a tree hugger would love, what would be the only thing missing except the "keeping up with the Jones'" mentality.

<TEXT>It has a very comfortable cabin layout, smooth ride, and great handling. If you need any more in those departments, you need a sports car or a luxury sedan. So far, it's got 3 months and 3,000 miles on it and no complaints. Gas mileage around 27-28 with 40/60 hwy/city use. The bang for the buck factor is huge. The brakes are a bit grabby when cold, but perform well with no noticeable fade. Acceleration is great (for an engine this size). The seats are very comfy (fits 4 adults well). Very gadget-friendly: aux audio input, 2 12V jacks and handy storage areas. This car is not all things to all people, but you should definitely consider it if you're looking at this price and/or size range.</TEXT>

I have put around 300 miles on it and it's getting about 23.5 mpg and climbing. This lower mpg was due to a lead footed car porter. I am shocked at how well this car handles on the highway.

<TEXT>I'll keep it simple. This is a confident, high quality small/midsized sedan with a very nice interior, quiet highway ride, good efficiency, tight panel gaps, stellar warranty and a nice overall feel. It looks better in person than it does in pictures. It has nice presence in real life. It's reasonably peppy for a 2.0 4 banger and does all that's asked of it. The power is right in the perfect range for the type of driving that 90% of people do. It chugs around at low RPM approaching V6 feel. It climbs hills well at highway speeds and zips around town like a champ. It holds its own in spirited driving and has a satisfying soul. Like a best compromize Mazda3/Jetta/Civic.</TEXT>

This is also a great car for new learners. So easy to operate. Very tight turning radious. The headlights also do a great job of lighting up the road.

<TEXT>2,000 Miles into my daughter's new '07 Elantra and I'm very impressed. Hyundai's done a really nice redesign on this vehicle. I wouldn't have considered its predecessor, but I'm thrilled with the quality and value it represents. Not only does it get great gas mileage, but its a very solid car and loaded with features for the money. My choice was narrowed down to it and the Honda Civic LX. The Honda was very nice too, but for nearly $3000. less, the Elantra offered more features and a longer warranty. My parents were the first ones in the family to buy a Hyundai, the '06 Sonata. I was impressed with the quality and value of that car and believe Hyundai is getting the formula down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our family has always been a "Toyota-only" consumer when it comes to automobiles, so when my relatives found out we were even considering the Elantra, they thought we were were crazy. But having done my research, the Elantra would give us all the features we looked for in a car without having to break the bank- and we have not been disappointed! More room than the Corolla or Civic, enough for two car seats in the back. You gotta love the standard safety features, sweet warranty, and the dashboard blue lights that add a nice touch. The gas mileage has been great and altogether, it has been a great car for me to commute to work and lug around the kids. Even the relatives love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, interior space, blue dashlight illumination, vanity mirror lighting, MP3 player jack. With the all new redesigned lineup, I foresee Hyundai's image and resale value only increasing in the future.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall, I like my first Hyundai. I had some initial problems that were scary. The transmission had several episodes of rough shifting/jerking. The Owner's Manual said the transmission has a learning curve. My last 5 Hondas never gave me shift shock while learning my driving habits. The mileage avgs have been 29city and 33hwy after 1800 miles. The car is quiet and comfortable. Now my biggest issue is the Speedometer. It was reading high by 9%. Hyundai changed the Instrument Cluster, which brought the error within their specs. It still reads high by 8% and Hyundai's DPSM will not allow any more work on this problem. Everyone, think about your odometer running you out of warranty early.</TEXT>
