<TEXT>Bought this car Aug 2007. Drove it off the lot with 12 miles on it (now has 40,000miles in 2009). It gets great gas miles and has been very reliable. I bought it to get through nursing school and could not be more pleased (payments are awesome too! Only $230 month). I have heard a lot of negative things about Kia cars and honestly don't know what is so horrible. I graduate in 8 months and will drive my Rio for as long as I can.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's exterior design is very pleasing to the eye. Cute lil thing. Large trunk for such a small car. **Most importantly, the warranty that I got with the car (nice plus).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like that way this car handles and that is what sold me. The repair problems have made me decide to get rid of this car after having had it only 10 months. It seems like it's hard to keep ahead of it falling apart. I have never had the misfortune to have ever gotten a car like this before. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Small sporty size and handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The check engine light has always turned on intermittently. The AC had to be fixed twice within the first 2 years. The brake switch went out at about 2 years so no brake lights worked. Had to drive about 40 mins to get to the closest dealership and Kia would not offer a rental car during all of the warranty work. They insisted that the 30,000 service be done at 28,000 miles or they would stop providing warranty work. Now engine won't start half the time and it just reached 30,000 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This was a horrible purchase. Terrible MPG 16-18 max. Brakes shot @ less then 9,000 miles in the shop 9 times for charging problem. This car looks ok, highly overrated!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went from an 03 impala to an 07 Rio. Lots of loss in room, But much more gained in MPG and Reliability. Definitely not a family car, but for a high school or college student, work car, or first car, this is perfect. Cheap off the lot, cheap on gas, NOT cheaply made. An extremely nice car. Definitely not luxury, but who needs that expensive stuff anyways. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice sound system for stock. Comfortable and smooth drive. GREAT on gas. Body styling is not bad at all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the car is July of 2007. Brand new with only 6 miles. I've owned Kia's in the past but nothing like this one. It has the worst gas mileage I've ever experienced. Not all of the 2007 Models are like this. I know of a lot of them that get 40+ MPG. But if your lucky like me then you will find yourself getting 16-18 mpg hwy doing 55-65 mph. If I could go back in time I'd buy a Honda or a Toyota. After taking the car to 5 dealerships they never did fix the problem and have stated they could not find one. You may be one of the lucky ones if you buy this vehicle but there is that other possibility.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car gets great mileage and lots of room for the price. Much more stylish than the Yaris or Aveo and much lower sticker price. Not much power, but I was looking for mileage, not power. 6 advanced airbags make me feel safer in such a small car. Brake rotors shimmy but could have been from rough braking in the past. Otherwise, love the car. For the price it seems like the best deal out there. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior appearance, great mileage, good interior room. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased the vehicle in May of last year. It is a cute economical disposable car but, here it is a year later and the car can't pass inspection because there is a bubble in the tire they said from a pothole living in New York. It's a great possibility but, they offered no help to resolve the situation. One of the main reasons for purchasing this particular vehicle was the gas mileage and it gets nowhere near what is says would. When we asked the dealer we were told it was the gas. We use exxon company has been around along time. I will never purchase another Kia again. This is the first time I've had problems like that. They told us exxon gas was bad it doesn't matter what gas it's still bad.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Kia Rio5 has been in the shop this past month 5 times for the same issue! Kia will only approve the minimal amount of repairs and has yet to fix my vehicle. For the last month, I have been without my car and after the engine and oxygen sensor has been replaced, the vehicle is still broken. What does Kia say??? Nothing. They will not return my phone calls. Whats the use of a 10 year/100,000 mile warranty, if Kia will not make good on it! Don't buy Kia! The cars are cute and fuel efficient, but not dependable and Kia does not stand behind their product!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a new Hyundai Santa Fe Ltd last Fall. And although I love driving the vehicle, I'm not thrilled with my mileage. I spent one night looking on the net for a "get about town" car and found the Rio. Love this little gem. A fun car to drive and 30+ mpg city. Sometimes miss the bells and whistles (my seat warmers and power door locks) but this car is a blast! Great heater, surprising trunk space. Add a good window tint, and it has a great look. Not "budget" at all; a real bargain. Remains to be seen about reliability, and the A/C. But with the great warranty, I'm just not worried. Not my choice for a long road trip, except for mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had this car for 1 year and what a mistake. Should have stayed w/Hyundai Accent but they didn't offer a 4dr hatch. Have had a constant speed sensor problem on the auto trans. The car is slow, handles poorly in the snow and less than good gas mileage. Avg 28 combined city/hywy. Should get better mileage w/such a small engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one of the better budget cars. Decent gas mileage at a greatly affordable price. I'm 6'1" and have no problem fitting in. With the leadfoot I have my gas is still 32 mpg. The problem I have is the power. It can not pull its own weight up a hill without having to downshift even at 65 mph and at lower speeds on a hill it searches for a gear constantly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just sit in one. This model has a nice sporty interior. Leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter. Sport stitched seating. The exterior is sporty with a unique look not to be mistaken for all the other models out there in it's class. Though it's not going to win any races, it is fun to drive. It handles well and sticks to the road. It's a compact car, so the ride is a little bumpy. It has front and side front airbags as standard safety equipment. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The design inside and out. It doesn't look like all the other cars on the road. Unique front and rear design. The sidelines are a thing of beauty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Rio for a few months now, and still love it as much as when I bought it. I test drove an Elantra just before I drove the Rio, and I didn't notice any difference in the ride or power. The 5 speed manual is a blast, with a light clutch, and the engine really starts kicking when over 3500 rpm. The suspension is excellent, as is the fuel economy. It is noticeably taller than most other cars, making you feel more like you're driving a van than an economy car. It has more interior room than the Toyota Corolla.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The peppy engine and good suspension coupled with the 5 speed makes it a blast to drive, and steping on the gas doesn't seem to affect the economy that much. I regularly get 32-33 mpg with about 75% highway, with the awesome AC on as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the Kia Rio to replace my aging Mazda Protege as a daily commuting car. I needed a car with good gas mileage, great air and a CD/FM/AM unit. I got a great car for little money. The Chevy Cobalt was considered along with the Rio and after having driven both, I am more than impressed with the Kia. Sure, it only has a 1.6 liter engine with 110 hp, but the VVT engine really does a great job. The interior may be cheap compared to the Hondas and Toyotas of this world, but then that's reflected in the price. Yet it is a darn site better than the Cobalt which has some really *scary* plastics inside and looks nasty too. The Rio is a bif car for really not much money!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound system and the really great air conditioner.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had an old beater before I bought my Kia Rio thinking I was saving money by not buying a new car. When I found out I could get a brand new car for about the same I was paying in repairs to my old car I was sold. The car has enough pick up to get going and a small enough engine to get great gas mileage. Not to mention the warranty is amazing. I recommend this vehicle for anyone who was a good, reliable car that doesn't cost them an arm and a leg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the price, warranty, and driving it on windy mountain roads.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The best thing about this vehicle is the fact that it gets 30 miles to the gallon. This is especially important due to the fact that I work 30 miles away from home. Another aspect of this car that appeals to me is how much room this little car has and how comfortable it is. It is an excellent vehicle for the money. I have 5 speed manual shifting, and the only problem I had, at first, was figuring out how to put in in reverse. You need to pull up a lever, pull the shifter all the way to your left and up to put into reverse. Once I got it, however, there no longer was any confusion. This is a minor set back.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car handles very well, on the highway or not. It takes corners very well, and to emphasize the gas mileage, 35 MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Kia Rio5 SX is actually a fine car. The mileage has been excellent (though not quite what I'd expect), the ride is very good and the design is really eye-pleasing. Overall, no one who has been in and seen this car can believe that it is a Kia and that it comes in at such a low cost.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Rio5, it's great on fuel and it handles the road like a BMW. The styling inside and out is very nice. I love the black interior with the triple stitched red thread. I got my car in the sunset orange which really pops in the sunlight.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>10 year 100 thousand mile warranty. The peppy 1.6l 4cyl motor has a lot of get up and go. The suspension feels great and helps my Rio5 hold the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a 140 mile round trip commute and needed a good mpg car. I knew the Kia would get good mileage and the long warranty was important, but I did not expect it would be so fun to drive. I have actually had it up to 100 mph and seemed like it had a little more to give, I didn't want to push my luck though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As I was comparing around, my 1st test drive immediately told me I got to have this baby. It was smooth and fun to drive. PLUS very quiet with low noise. It is really a great car to own without burning a big hole in my wallet. The fuel consumption is great too. I get 15km/l with 50% city and 50% highway driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look is great and the space is just nice for 5. The noise insulation is not expected for a budget car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>You gotta drive this thing, I love it. I read a review that said this was not a good car. Go drive one. I drove some of the other cars in its class and the Rio is bigger than most and more power than most. 6 airbags and an awesome look to it. Plenty of room for all my junk. I have 3 kids that I take with me when my wife is at work and we fit perfect. </TEXT>
