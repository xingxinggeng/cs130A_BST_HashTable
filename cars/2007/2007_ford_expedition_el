<TEXT>I drive a considerable amount of miles per year. This car has been the best and most reliable suv I have ever owned. I would buy a new one without a second thought. Ford really got this one right.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Living in Florida, the cooling seat feature comes in very handy. The rear back up sensor has been a lifesaver. The space is great-my teenagers aren't on top of eachother. This car is like the little black dress-great for just about anything form Home Depot to a valet at an event.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Expedition. My first was a 2000 model. This vehicle is comfortable to drive, gets decent gas mileage (about 18 mph life of vehicle average) and is great for transporting people and cargo. But at 36,900 miles the front right brake locked up and got super hot. The dealership can't explain what caused the problem. And it is 900 miles out of warranty. This problem hasn't been resolved yet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of cargo and passenger space. Comfortable ride and entertainment options for trips. Decent gas mileage for a full size SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We really enjoy our EL. It is fun, safe, roomy, quiet, gives us about 19 mpg on the highway at 70-80 mph. It gives us about 13.8 around the city, and I'll pay for the gas for the added safety of the F-150 chassis. The visibility is excellent, great mirrors, and backup sensors make you look like a pro when parking. The turning radius is better than many "small" cars. The Limited is about 10K cheaper than the Linclon Navigatior and I can't see the value in the Navigator. The Ford gives you everything you need. You can't go wrong with this vehicle. It's worth every cent of the extra fuel that you burn over a crappy little car that you will learn to hate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All of them. The voice activated system stinks, but who wants to talk to a car anyway. The backup sensors are worth thier weight in gold.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My right front brake caliper failed at less than 41000 miles resulting in approx. $700.00 in repairs. Ford Motor Company denied any assistance for the repairs on a vehicle that is TWO YEARS OLD ! I understand that the vehicle was 4000 miles over warranty, however this is a NEW vehicle. I am curious to see if any other Expedition owners have a similiar story to tell. Ford's poor treatment of a long time customer has me doubting my brand loyalty. I am totally dissatisfied with their handling of my situation and advised them I would be sharing my experience with other consumers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold flat power rear seat. Excellent relationship with my dealership,but not happy with Ford Motor Company at this point !!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this SUV due to having an older expedition and loving it. We wanted a little more room and 4 WD. I was worried about fuel and mileage but not worried anymore. I love the leather and the dvd system. Plenty of storage even when the 3rd row seat is up. I recommend this SUV to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Traction control and DVD system for the kids, plus the gas and break pedal move to accommodate a short person. Love it!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this SUV and loved the interior room. Drives nicely and feel safe on every drive.I was worried about the Fuel Economy; however it is only 1 mile less per gallon than my Toyota Sienna. I do not even notice the mileage difference. Would highly recommend this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>A true sports car fan, but must say I really love the versitillity & handling of this vehicle. Ford did a great job on the design both exterior and interior. Bought an 07 closeout so I wasn't able to find all the options desired in the color desired, but love it just the same. The stereo is wonderful and road noise is minimal. Love the extra wide back doors which makes loading of both cargo and people so easy. The leg room is great even in the 3rd row. The only item I still have trouble with are the window buttons. I think it is more of an operator than design. Still under 5K in miles but getting 16 MPG and say that will get better. I feel very safe, easy to handle and a smooth ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We drive the wheels off this vehicle (47,000 miles in less than two years) and feel qualified to write a comprehensive review. This is the third Expedition we've owned and definitely the best of the lot. My wife hauls our three sons and their buddies all over the place. I am an 18 year state trooper accident reconstructionist and am thoroughly impressed with safety considerations designed into this vehicle (side airbags down the full length of the cabin, nimble steering, excellent brakes, roll stability control, and traction control). This is a very capable large vehicle, much better than the Excursion or any competitor in overall usefulness and safety. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We leased this vehicle in December of 06 as soon as it hit the showroom. We don't have a bunch of kids and use it strictly to go back and forth from our vacation home. The vehicle does not hold up well even with just 2 adults. We have had carpet pull loose twice, an armrest break and something happens occasionally at stop lights that feels like another car rear ended us. The dealership tells us they have never heard of this although other owner's Expeditions have been known to do this also. Very underpowered for a vehicle of this size. We don't haul with it, have an F250 for that so I can't think of any excuse. Really glad it's a lease can't wait to turn it in. Going back to GM.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the Expedition, like others, when our third child was born. We ran out of room (even with third row seating) in my 2006 Explorer EB to put all three car seats as well as put a double stroller in the cargo area. This SUV is top-notch. Everything I was looking for in an SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior and exterior design are far superior to GM, Powerfold 3rd row ensures no climbing in the cargo area to fold seats down, power liftgate, plenty of powerpoints, 2 tone charcoal/tan leather seating, large sunroof</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased mid Nov, 7000 miles in less than 2 month and really enjoyed the drive. Some one needs to wakeup about gas mileage, my 57 olds 98 got better gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having been a loyal Ford customer for several years. I purchased a 2002 Explorer for the fold down 3rd row. since then and 3 kids later and teaching rescue classes I was running short on space for my kids and equipment! After waiting several years for the Expedition EL I have been enjoying it's flexibility from hauling kids & equipment to carrying lumber from Lowes for that weekend project! The EL gives my the capabilities of a full length pick-up while being able to haul dlicate items all in the same trip! Oh yeah... And transport a family of 5!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>3rd row seating is second to none! I gave GM, Toyota, Dodge, all a chance to convince me their 3rd rows were better. But all said their 3rd row seats couldn't fold flat. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wife always wanted large SUV, and when we had our last son, this gave here a reason to move up from Honda Element. We love this truck! Very, very comfortable and roomy. I thought this truck was just too big and excessive until I took it camping. Great for towing, never knew I had anything back there.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best feature by far is the 3rd row auto fold!. I can't figure out why GM hasn't incorporated this feature into their product line. It was definitely one of the deciding factors when I made the prchase. Also Love the rear auto door, and the heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have 3 kids and decided to go back to a large vehicle. So we traded our 2006 Highlander for the Ford EL Limited. Have 7500 miles on it so far and we are very happy with it. Better interior and exterior quality than Toyota. On the highway we are averaging 19.5 mpg on the freeway at 75 - 80 mph. This vehicle is comfortable to drive, has great interior features, fits the family and all the gear, and it is an overall great choice for large families. I am 6'4" tall and have to actaully move the seat forward to get the best driving position. Can set legs totally straight. Interior DVD w/ cordless headsets keep parents sane on long trips. Nav system is excellent. Love the redesign! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2 tier loading. Cordless headsets for DVD. Navigation, power liftgate, heated & cooled seats. Tri-coat paint </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Watch out GMC Yukon XL and Chevy Suburban. This Ford has been an excellent vehicle. Expeditions are about $4,000 less than the previous year. The Ford EL Limited has more standard equipment including a wrap around air bag system that protects passengers all the back to the third row. I own a 2004 Yukon XL and went to the local GMC dealer to purchase another for our growing family. Before the purchase, I decided to go to the Ford dealer to see what Ford had engineered with the EL - wow. A joy to drive and more for your money. Do a comparison on Edmunds, but compare apples to apples. The Ford EL standard equipment is optional on the Chevy and Yukon. Test drive for yourself.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard features including the side air bags, 4 wheel independent suspension for a superior ride, six speed transmission, exterior entry keypad, 18" wheels, traction control. At first glance the Ford EL MSRP is more, but GM doesn't even offer any of these standard options. Ford has finally done it</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Recently purchased the new EL Limited 4X4 after reading all the reviews. Drives very smooth and not like my 99 XLT (which is more like a truck). Can?t wait to drive this SUV around. Handles great, sound system is very nice; interior is a major upgrade, exterior get the ?WOW? effect from on-lookers. I feel like I got my money?s worth here! Good for Ford! It?s about time! </TEXT>

<TEXT>On our way to CO from TX we got a chance to test AdvanceTrac with Roll Stability Control. I could easily say this technology saved our lives (8 adults WITH luggage). It was dark and a few deer showed up in front of us. We were going ~80mph and my sister instinctively threw the steering wheel sharply to the right. I immediately braced for rollover because a maneuver like that would have surely flipped us over; but it did not. While we fishtailed violently in the aftermath my sister needed only to hold the steering wheel straight. The car regained control soon after and we were all amazed at how it did it. To think what could have happened if this feature hadn?t come standard is frightening.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With an EL XLT pretty much everything we got was standard. Of the standard features our favorites are: RSC; instant fuel economy, miles to empty, and on-board diagnostics check; extremely smooth ride; great sounding stock stereo system; adult-friendly 3rd row seats; smooth 6-speed tranny.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Top of the line $52K Limited, literally every option. Love the size, comfort, quietness, rigidity, towing capacity and so much more. I owned a 2003 Exp and really loved it. That ownership experience brought me back to buy the new one. Overall Ford has done a spectacular job improving the vehicle. The engine is notably more powerful but the fuel economy still stinks. Of course being over 3 tons what should I expect? My neighbor purchased a new Tahoe, and this Exp kicks it big time! I have had lots of vehicles, and this one promises to be my favorite yet. I do wish it had a backup camera like the Infiniti and I hope when Ford offers it I can retrofit. Nav system needs improved.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, ride, quiet, look, feel, ergonomics, roominess, fold down seats, flat loading surface, air bag suspension, folding mirrors, vented rear windows, fuel capacity (though I want even more), fit and finish, color (tri coat white), big chrome wheels, heat & air, and on and on. Try the Lincoln too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Expedition since approximately 1996, the last 3 were Eddie Bauer versions. Without question the 2007 version has undergone the most notable change from any other year. Most significant is the insulation, shifter configuration, ride, and availability of "high-end" features (i.e., heated & AC seats, auto rear lift & close tailgate, navigation, etc.). In my opinion the car is evolving into the Lincoln Navigator (LN) at a rapid pace. Unless the LN is turbo charged and upgraded with a Rolls Royce transmission, these vehicles will be nearly identical in 5-6 years.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hot/cold seats actually work & are probably the most novel feature. However, the auto tailgate is probably the most practical. The navigation system is neat but hard to justify. The ride & insulation are much better than the 04 model. I heard air-shocks make the ride better. I didn't buy them.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The ride is excellent. I have had 7 back surgeries and couldn't ride/drive more than 3 1/2 hrs. I have driven 7 hours with no pain in the Expedition.The memory seats and air/heat seats have really helped me. I need to read and learn how to program seats for my wife a great benefit. The sound system with DVD is awesome. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After being completely set on a Chevy Suburban we changed our minds after seeing this vehicle. We have only had for a week or so at this point, but LOVE it. It is the size of a transfer truck but handles like a little car. I am IMPRESSED by the comfortable ride and all the nice little features.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power lift gate and NAV system is great, but also the roomy console in the front and the ease of the steering wheel controls. The sound system is great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I needed a SUV, fully loaded for family of 5. The EL Limited has exceeded all expectations. Smooth lines inside and out. Voice navigation, A/C for the seat (yes seat). The room is unbelievable. Nicer that most Navigators but cheaper. 9000lbs of towing capacity with auto leveling feature. Overall very pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After extensive research and testing of a large variety of suvs/minivans, I chose the Eddie Bauer Expedition EL. Got upgraded 20-inch wheels, gold on white paint, and it's oh so baaad! Could not believe how much better the Expedition drove than the Nissan Armada, Toyota Sequoia, et al. Expedition has nice exhaust note, but quiet at cruise. Low mpg (15 around town, 18 highway) doesn't bother me, what else would you expect? New interior design is fantastic! Great fit/finish. Smooth transmission. Great ride, even with 20-inch wheels. Luxury features are also top notch. The cornering/handling for such a heavy vehicle is also amazing! None of that "top heavy" feel whatsoever.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Memory seats, nav system (with voice recognition), satellite radio, power folding rear seats, power rear liftgate, message center, roomy 2nd/3rd row. Wife likes heated seats most. I cannot stress enough how luxurious the Expedition feels from behind the wheel! Do yourself a favor, test drive this vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Received call today that our EL was in. Loaded the family up and went on a 65 mile run on I-10. 75 MPH. Mileage 19.2. After that, in town, 15.6 MPG. Stereo is straight from Pimp My Ride. The kids said as soon as the thumping stopped - cool! Third row for me at 6'1" is very roomy. 2nd row captains are great. Front seats with heat and A/C are super. Adjustments are luxury at its best. DVD/NAV screen is super. Brightness and ease of use are fine. 3rd row power fold without taking headrest off is great. Only CHEAP is the chrome clad wheel covers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Color - White Sand. HUGE looking but small feeling when you need to maneuver. Ride is Cadillac like - Smoooooooth! H.P. is appropriate. No trailer tow yet. Nav system is as good as a Lexus I have been in. Stereo is "sick" as my kids say.</FAVORITE>
