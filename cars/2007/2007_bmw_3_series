<TEXT>Like most other BMW owners that bought their vehicles with RFTs, I too had a less than positive experience. It was a rougher ride than my '02 M3 after 15k miles. I'm ready for my first tire replacements at 30K miles and fortunately took it in for service before buying new tires. Complained about them to the service guy and he finally agreed they weren't getting rave reviews and said, under his breath, that people switching to regular tires noticed a marked improvement in handling, noise and comfort. He also said BMW now sells a "Mobility" kit for non-RFT tires (comes standard with new M's apparently) that is basically a fancy tire repair in a can. Ordering new Michelin's today!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo--smooth and fast. Feels better than my old M3 and gets 30 mpg on freeway. Styling and interior--Nav system is ok, handsfree phone works great</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My beautiful alpine white BMW 328XI AWD 4dr.sedan has been in the shop 12 times, first time 6 months after purchase. Major computer problems;computer indicator pops up with visuals not in the handbook. Service @ BMW has had difficulty reprogramming the computer. Poor handling dealing with pot holes. Little things go wrong with the car all the time. Car serviced at a different dealer than purchase. BMW corporate says that the service dept. has been able to fix the problems the car has had, but the vehicle is not reliable and I don't feel safe driving it. Afraid to drive the car long distances for fear of being stranded. This ultimate driving machine is a NIGHTMARE=LEMON!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the style. Drives well in short distances.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased this car in February 07 and have about 6 months left on a 36 month lease. I have just put on my third set of run flat tires (at 30,000 miles). I wish I had checked the reviews of this problem before I purchased the car. There are thousands of people who swear they will never buy or lease another bmw because of these miserable tires. They are expensive, and ride like a truck.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Disappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I had the car less than a month when I hit a pot hole on the Long Beach Freeway popping one tire and bending two rims. The ride is horrible when going over small bumps and it bottoms out on small speed bumps. I had to replace both rear tires at 20,000 miles as they were completely worn through on the inside. The dealer helped with this due to the earlier problem, but the tires should last much longer. There is no window switch in the back seat! The rear seat passengers have to ask the driver to lower or raise the window. The car is beautiful, but I'm glad I'm leasing it because it's going back at the end of the lease!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 335i Convertible is a great year round car. Hardtop is splendid, and top down is, well an ideal convertible experience. Performance with the 300HP Twin Turbo is seamless and strong. Nice exhaust note. Would not recommend the Sport Package. Tires are different sized front to rear and terrible runflats (Bridgestones). They were OK until about 7000 miles and then feathered, cupped and droned all the time. Awful experience, dealer and BMW were not helpful. Beware, these tires on Sport Package cannot be rotated and the Run Flats ruined my BMW experience. Never again. Otherwise, car is great, but tires are so important as that is your contact with the road. Shame on BMW for using that tire. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hardtop convertible, Twin Turbo engine, lots of power and no turbo lag, Xenon headlamps with rotation, Great car after Michelin Run Flats installed, fuel economy (30 on Hwy, 27 in normal driving). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very fun, good looking car to drive. The acceleration is amazing and effortless. Very quiet cabin and poised until you're surprised by a bump. This car is very customizable to your preferences. Having the comfort access gives this car an extra lux quality. However, all the technology makes me afraid that it's going to be an expensive car to maintain in the long run. The seatbelt assist arm has acted up a few times already. City gas mileage is horrible, but highway is better than my last car (avg 17/27). At the end, I'm glad I bought this car. The best car I've ever owned by far. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort Access, ipod, sinking in seat feeling from acceleration. Turns heads on the street. Love the look and function of the adaptive xenon headlights. Heated seats are fast to warm up. I wish I can look at the car as I drive it. I know, it's weird.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After actually ordering a car for the first time I was very excited to own the "ultimate driving machine". However it became the ULTIMATE NIGHTMARE. The tapping noise the engine made should never happen on a premium car like this. It became a battle to have BMW admit to it and have it fixed. They are well aware of the problem yet still sell new cars with this defect. My car was damaged at the dealer trying to have this repair done and this was a result of BMW not standing behind their product. These cars are overpriced and overrated.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked this car up last week as certified pre-owned and it's the ONLY way to go with BMW! You get the benefits of a new car in terms of warranties for the price of a used car. I got a maintenance plan to cover up to 100,000 miles which is a MUST if you plan on keeping your car and not leasing. The one I got is fully loaded with every possible upgrade and the incredible thing is that I got it all for under $30K out the door! This car brand new with it's options would have easily cost over $50K!!!</TEXT>

I have not had it in the snow yet, but with all-wheel drive I am sure it will do fine. I have not had as much pleasure in driving for many years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Generally, I'm pleased with my 328xi and looking forward to winter in the Colorado mountains. I like the 6 speed manual transmission, although I think the car is slightly underpowered compared to my Audi A4 2.0. I love the convenience locks and the pushbutton start. So far, no mechanical problems, but I think the no flat tires are overly loud on the freeway. All in all, the car sticks to the road like glue and is fun to drive on mountain roads (not so fun in tight parking lots). </TEXT>

<TEXT>I agree with all the other positive statements. Things I didn't like were 1) the runflats and the fact that the car does not come with a spare or a jack kit. 2) My car was built in 4/2007 and they were still using a fuel pump made by Seimens. Many Seimens fuel pumps have failed and mine is having symptoms of failure (long crank starts 4-5 seconds). BMW has not issued a recall and is handling the issue on a case by case basis. It is assumed that all new cars now have the improved fuel pump made by bosch although BMW won't confirm the date they made the switch. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine performance and easy performance modifications. Handling is excellent. Get rid of the run flats, buy a jack kit and you will drop quite a few pounds off the vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very pleased. Handles very well with a neutral, flat and connected feel to the car. Ergonomics fit me very well and interior is roomy for a compact car. Run flats are acceptable, ride-wise, although once worn, I'll replace with Michelins and put some fix/flat in trunk. Bluetooth works very well. Fantastic leather and interior fit/finish is great but glove box is smallish. For the high price of admission, the standard sound system should be better - okay, but the Logic 7 system shouldn't be an option at this price. Push button start system is, I think, unique. Some may say it's odd or gimmicky. Good power but if you're a power monger pop for the 335.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, ride quality and fit/finish of interior. Bluetooth. The barbera red metallic paint with beige leather/wood trim is handsome. 4 years free maintenance. Decent mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my new 328i wagon. Plenty of room for two little dog crates even with the back seat up. Get decent MPG, certainly better than my x5 got. Handles wonderfully, rides GREAT, iDrive is fun, GPS is amazing, and I get lots of compliments on the color combo (barbaro red with tan interior). The thing I hate are the run-flat tires! I have my second flat in the 4 months I own the car. Not the car's fault, but I now need to take hours to drive to the dealer, wait for them to sell me another tire. I don't have time for this, not to mention the cost. I want to be able to change/fix the flat and get on with my life.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is hands down the worst vehicle I have ever owned. Within the first 2 weeks it was in the shop twice for electrical problems. Then when I was driving on the highway, I hit the gas and didn't go anywhere and almost got creamed, twice. Performance is no where near all the hype and it is a very uncomfortable car to drive longer than 2 hours in. The bluetooth feature is garbage and the recieving quality on whom you are calling is very bad. The gas mileage is terrible in city and hwy driving. Overall a terrible car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Always wanted a BMW 3-series with 6-speed manual. Fell in love with the 2007 coupe, but way past that now. Underwhelming acceleration and torque below 2700 RPM. Tranny has been big disappointment. Maddening HVAC and radio controls. Poorly shaped and sized storage cubbies. Can't see instrument lights with sunglasses. Under 3K miles had to replace driveshaft. At 4K, weird vibration in clutch pedal. Dealer diagnosed bad throwout bearing and replaced whole clutch. The vibration got worse! Now they tell me it'll "break-in" after 10-15K miles. It's hard to enjoy my "driver's car" when my clutch foot is tingling, and I'm being tortured by diabolically illogical controls and wretched ergonomics.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Never Satisfied</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I never expected to say that my VW Passat had more attention to detail than the car I've waited so long to own, but my BMW falls short in some areas, including: a less impressive dash display; a headrest that tilts too far forward and can't be adjusted; a trip computer stop watch that must be manually reset for each trip (it auto reset on the VW); a manual that must be stored in the trunk (the VW had a compartment for it under the steering wheel); back window controls are situated where I expect the front to be; door lock control is on the dash rather than the driver's door (forces you to get back in the car if you forget to unlock all doors before getting out).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Push button start is cool, handles curves nicely. (But after driving a loaner with the sport package I realized the sport seats are more comfortable and the tighter suspension actually makes for a smoother ride, not bumpier as it was described by the first salesperson I went to for a test drive.)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having my car for only 4 months, the seat belt arm broke. It took 4 visits to the dealership until they finally fixed the problem. When my car was 10 months old, the windshield wiper fluid pump stops working. It took 2 visits and they kept it in the shop for a total of 3 days until the realized there was a huge air bubble. It was very annoying that these little repairs take so many visits and time to be repaired. Every now and then my SOS doesn't work, which causes my bluetooth to malfunction. Other than that, the car drives well and I still like the slick look.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very happy with my car. It's fast and fun and zippy, just like I had hoped it would be. I am actually shocked that I haven't gotten a ticket yet (knock on wood). It doesn't feel like I'm going that fast, but before I know it, I'm pushing 90! It was a pleasure driving an hour and a half each way to Palm Springs for a weekend, except for the seats made my back sore. I guess I have gotten used to it, though, because I don't have that problem anymore. I highly recommend this car. It gets a lot of looks, but it's not so flashy that I feel uncomfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After an exhaustive (and exhausting!) search my wife and I finally decided to get our first BMW. Having driven a series of 5 Saabs in a row it was a time to move on. We explored BMW, Audi, Infiniti, Lexus, Acura, Volvo, and Cadillac. Based on reviews, prestige/market segment, price, features, and overall driving quality the BMW was a clear winner. Love the car and the engine is amazing. It continues to win me over every time we take it out! Mileage has been better than expected and we are enjoying learning how to use all of the features the car offers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>End of lease was nearing on my Audi A4 3.2 Quattro and I planning to purchase the car. Bored and nothing to do a couple weekends ago, I decided to stop by the closest BMW dealer to check out the 335i. After the test drive, I was instantly sold. Before I pulled the trigger, drove the G35 and the IS 350, but clearly the 335i was the Ultimate Driving Machine. Tons of power available at any speed. Handling is superb and the car is incredibly balanced. Can't say that about the A4. Fit and finish of the car is first rate. Interior is clean and laid out nicely. Great stereo. The sport seats keep you firmly in place. Awesome car to drive. Fast and fun! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Is there a word greater than great? That is the word I would use. The sound system is the best I have ever heard. The reviews where drivers say they look for excuses to drive this car are true. Believe it when you read it. I love the power, the sound, the illuminated outside lighting when you unlock the car at night. My last car was a Crossfire. I thought is was impressive until I drove this car. I have had it more than a month and know that all of my future cars will be BMW's. I have an automatic and added the sports package. If you are reading this and considering getting a 328i sedan... well... don't walk but run to the local dealership. You won't be sorry. It is worth every penny.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new 328i, BMW just keeps making cars that make me and many others so happy. No wonder editors of enthusiast magazines have to make public announcements explaining they are not on the Bavarian payroll (yes BMW advertises but so do the other manufacturers) when these cars keep winning head-to head comparisons with their competitors. My third 3 series and the most luxurious and comfortable yet, the car has grown with my own girth and obviously it?s not just me enjoying the extra space as I?m seeing more and more on the road. If you enjoy driving and you are looking for a smaller car that just makes you smile when you have to push it harder than normal this is the car for you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new brakes are amazing, it?s disconcerting driving other cars now because the stopping power of the BMW is as good as it gets on a production car of this caliber. The new rear suspension also impresses me, it does not want to give up grip and people in the back seem more comfortable than before</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove a 2002 BMW 325i and it was a fun car to drive. Just bought the 328i with Premium and Sports PKG. This car is powerful and fun to drive. The car feels solid and the communication with the road is second to none. The engine power and overall excellent driving experience is what you would expect from a BMW. The brakes are solid and make you feel confident your care will stop on a dime. Transmission, engine and every other component work in precise unison. The car still gets a lot of stares when on the road. I'm always looking for any excuse to drive it! The car is pricey in comparison to some of the competition but worth the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first BMW and wow, am I impressed. This car is flat out amazing. The best attributes are those characteristicts with the pure driving experience. If you love to drive, then you will love this car. The steering is amazingly precise, the brakes are strong yet smooth, the manual transmission is a joy to operate, the clutch is easy to use and then there's the engine. That twin turbo I-6 alone is reason enough to buy this car. To hear it rev is like pure automotive symphony. I love to rev this engine probably as much as the engine loves to rev. Cannot wait to hit the track one day. It also excels on the freeway - never got uncomfortable during an 11 hour trip. I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, steering, brakes, 6sp MT. And of course that engine note. I spend half the time with the radio off just so I can listen to that engine. Also got to love that torque. With so much torque, you'd have no problem cruising in 6th gear probably as low as 40. Launching away from tolls is fun.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first BMW car and now I understand why it is called German engineering. This car has great driving performances. The turns are sharp and the body itself is kept close to the ground. On the freeway it feels very steady and not floating. This car is very low and has a thick side skirt compared to other sedans. The navigation is also very useful but a bit slow, and it has shut down once, then which I had to reboot the car to start it again. Overall, the exterior of the car looks really cute and a bit chubby compared to the coupe which looks slim and sporty. This car is worth the money because of all the features and the driving experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT>There is a reason why this vehicle has won so many accolades over the years. This is one of the most involving and enjoyable vehicles I have ever driven. It feels like it is on rails the whole time, cornering so effortlessly it almost makes you believe that you are a world class driver. I've really never driven anything that imparts such a safe and stable feeling. The almost 50/50 weight distribution helps, along with a wonderful system of power, suspension and brakes. You can probably find some other car that has a few more toys on it, but you will not find a more involving and beautiful drive. Every time I get in the car it makes me want to take the long way home.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I decided to buy a car I wanted something classy, fun to drive (important criteria), and for a lack of a better way to describe it, had a pedigree behind the performance. I looked at all the usuals in the luxury sport sedan class but the BMW 335i left the biggest grin on my face and in the end it was an easy decision for me. BMW. This car feels faster than the factory specs of 300hp/300ftlb and from some reviews, it apparently is. The surprising thing though so far is that this car is quite good on gas although it does require premium. So far city driving has yielded figures of 25-27 mpg. My last hwy trip was 40 mpg and this was with some spirited driving. Highly recommend!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling! This thing looks sexy at any angle. Performance is unbelievable and gas mileage is impressive considering the engine. This is the first BMW 3-Series where I didn't feel cramped. It's quite roomy and the interior isn't ostentacious. It has a nice combination of simplicity and classiness. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the seventh BMW I have owned, my first one being a 1974 2002. And, it is by far the best one. The build is rock solid, the fit and finish first class, and the performance outstanding. The most attractive feature of this car (aside from its hard top convertible design) is its 3 liter twin turbo engine. With 300 lb ft of torque available all the way from 1500 to above 5000 rpm, this car accelerates like a sling shot. While the driving aspects are first class, the electronics leave something to be desired. The comfort access feature is supposed to allow keyless driving, but the Bluetooth does not work properly unless the key is in the slot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pamper yourself with this car, it is worth it! A 2007 BMW 328i convertible is the gift that keeps on giving. It may not be the most practical vehicle choice but it sure has been the most fun! A Mother's Day gift for my wife, the thrill and joy of this open-air baby just keeps on rewarding her as I have never seen her happier. Exceptionally comfortable and luxurious. The 3.0 liter in-line six with 230-hp is adequate. Surprisingly smooth on the road, quiet, and fuel economical. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had Infiniti G35 before and hesitated getting a BMW because of poor reliability track record of any new BMW models. The car looks beautiful and drives well, so I listened to recommendations and bought the 335 hardtop convertible. In the 2nd week, the hardtop started to slam down when closing and doesn't tighten. I took it back and it's been 4 days and I still don't have my car back. Comfort access features, navigation, and iDrive also have some bugs. While I like the car when it's working right, I don't think it's worth the hassle. It's been the worst experience with any car purchase across the board. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is ridiculous!! I've only had it for 3 and 1/2 weeks and I've already put 2,500 miles on it (including a 1200 mile round trip to Jersey). But this is the fastest car I've ever driven in. From the way it picks up from a dead start with all that torque to the way it handles SHARP turns, and it has a CRAZY mid range punch!!! To attest to the fact it's a fast car, the BMW M5 which is a 500 HP V10 only beat this car in the 1/4 mile by 1/10 of a second! I love this car and could go on forever about it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Simply put, for me and should be for you, this is the best convertible in its class. Most fun to drive. Gets all the looks, has plenty of power and handles like a pure sports car. It is stiff, but I expected it. If you want a soft Lexus type of ride this is not for you. I love the ride and feel very confident turning the car at high speeds. If you are looking for a sports convertible and you don't test ride this you are making a mistake. It's great to build the one you want as well. Your options, your colors, but the option packages can put you in the range of of a 5 or 6 series in price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is phenomenal. It has class-leading handling and feel, like no other car. It has an exceptional 6-speed automatic with comfort-shift mode, sport-shift mode, and manu-matic mode using paddle shifters, and "rev matching" available in all modes to boot (who needs a 6 speed manual when this is available?). And the engine... with GOBS of available torque at any RPM, propelling this car from 0-60 in under 5 seconds! BMW underrated the power in this car by a mile (this as way more than 300hp and 300lb-ft torque). I traded in my 2003 BMW 330i for this car, and haven't looked back! Handsome looks without being a police-magnet. I cannot think of a better sports sedan at ANY price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a fun luxury sports sedan and decided to try out the Lexus IS, MB C-Class and the BMW 3 Series. The 335i easily left the biggest grin on my face of the 3 cars I tested and in the end I bought one. All I can say is this car is incredible! Fast, fast, fast yet still behaves like a perfect gentleman. You better keep both hands on the steering wheel as this car gets up to speed VERY quickly and feels faster than the official numbers BMW states. Handles like it's on rails and awesome road feel. Fuel mileage is great for a car with 300hp. City driving so far I'm seeing about 25-27 mpg and hwy easily over 30mpg unless you drive it hard. All around an awesome car!</TEXT>

Like all BMWs the turning radius allows easier parking. I love the added shoulder room and the roomier back seat.

<TEXT>This car has it all. Keyless entry with convenient access, push-button start, twin-turbo! One feels the luxury immediately when you sit in the vehicle for the first time. I quickly noted the seats were supportive, the interior/exterior well designed and myriad numbers of buttons that have some important function strategically placed. The next things one notes are twin turbos that propel one from 0 to 60 in around 5 sec. Power is a necessity for me. This car is like owning a 2 year old 5 series in terms of luxury and beauty! I will have to admit some degree of turbo lag. The handling is fantastic to be a real wheel drive. Brakes are stellar.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The twin turbo pulls hard and embarrases other sedans or surprises hotrods with acceleration; the luxurious interior with high quality leather, wood grain panels, comfort seats, moonroof, large trunk; the exterior with completely gorgeous, aerodynamic styling, large rims and the handling with 50-50 weight ratio and stability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously owned a Chrysler Sebring convertible for ten years. For me to say that this car drives MUCH better would be an understatement. I tested this and the IS 250 and although there is nothing bad about the Lexus, the BMW is just a little better in every way. Exterior look, interior design, and drivability. I am not a 'track' driver and the performance package in my opinion is unnecessary if driving isn't your hobby. The standard suspension and steering is very enjoyable. If you take long trips and have the performance suspension, pray that they just paved the roads. Otherwise you'll feel every bump, dip, and stone on the road. All in all, the BMW is just a great car. Worth every penny!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the sport package with a manual transmission. Love the car. It has a perfect balance of performance and utility. Enough room to carry 4 people and luggage for a long weekend or to do some track days and autocross. Just keep in mind that while it has great power and decent handling, it is not a true sports car. On the track and autocross lighter cars that handle better catch it in corners. Not to say you can't have fun there but it isn't a truly dedicated track machine. The car really shines on long road trips. Quiet and will cruise at super legal speeds all day. Also has enough power to pass in 6th or climbs hills.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine. Lots of torque down low and tons of power for passing. On the track if you nail the apex you can really rocket out of the corners. On the highway there really isn't much need to down shift to pass, though it is much more fun if you do. Comfort access. Leave the keys in your pocket.</FAVORITE>

I have never had as much fun driving a car as I do with the BMW. Granted, it's pricey, doesn't come with as many features (my 4 yr old audi had way more features and was less expensive), but in terms of performance, man, this car certainly is the ultimate driving machine. Extremely quick on take-off, suspension is phenomenal, and braking is incredible. Not to mention, its styled so elegantly, that you will certainly get looks on the road.

When I first picked up the car I spent the whole day driving it and what a ride! I was completely blown away with the comfort, power, handling, and sheer beauty of this vehicle. The attention to detail is fantastic and I kept finding little things that would shock me with excitement. The engine sound is completely unlike any BMW I've ever driven - and I've driven a lot!

<TEXT>Initially I was not a BMW fan, I was a long time MB user. BMW's slogan the ultimate driving machine meant nothing to me. Until I drove one. I've always heard that BMWs drive like nothing else. This is very true, I have never felt more in-tune with a vehicle before. The responsive and agile handling of the car is excellent. As with most german cars fit, finish, and quality is at its best. The car feels so solid and refined. Every component of the car fits together perfectly. Interior is gorgeous and sporty, very driver oriented. Mercedes Benz is unmatched in luxury and refinement. But BMW's driving dynamics are superb. If you want the car to drive yo,u get an MB, yet if you're a driver, only BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was determined to buy an Acura TL or a G35 and did not even consider the 328i. I had been already been driving a 2001 325i and loved it. I ended up test driving all three cars (TL, G35, 328i). The 328i is just head and shoulders more elegant and sporty inside and out. Yes, price is significant, however, that is up to each individual to determine if it was worth it. I love the car. It drives like no other and the sports mode is very fast. Interior space is not bad and the trunk is not bad.</TEXT>

Thanks to the steptronic the ride can be cruizy, even docile then go to shockingly fast with the help of the paddle shifters, hence perfect car for my wife and me. Wonderful feel in the corners. Only the G35 came close. Apparently easily tuneable, I?m not sure if I could handle any more. Sports package a must, the 18" rims have a great look and the sports seats create an impeccably snug fit. A quick read of the owner?s manual reveals laundry list of incredible safety and performance features. I am unbelievably happy with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I recently traded in my 2003 C5 Corvette for a 2007 BMW 335i coupe and we have no regrets so far. I was in love with my Corvette and did not want to get rid of it, but with a baby on the way we needed a car with more space. I was never a fan of BMW cars. I always thought they were overpriced and highly over rated until I took one for a test drive. Wow! now I understand what all the hype is about. I've had my car for about a month now and it is simply amazing. The acceleration is actually better than my Corvette. The low-end torque from the turbos makes the car fly off the line and feel quicker than it really is. The handling is great and this car loves to be tossed around corners.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our US Spec 335i coupe with all available options. I have had it on the autobahn and tested the speed limiter, which is in fact at 155mph. I can run a Porsche 911, at least until they hit the 165 mph mark and keep going (what limiter?), otherwise we would spank the entry level 911. This car is faster than the advertised 0-60 in 5.3. My guess is more like 4.5. I dread the day we take it to the states, but I will save my money for speeding tickets starting now, I guess. This is the most fantastic car I have ever driven! The new upcoming M3 (maybe M5) is next for us! </TEXT>

With the new automatic transmission and sport package, you'll get an awesome handling during acceleration and during sharp cornering. It's been a joy for me to drive this baby. I can never get tired with it. I was going to buy the 335i, but the salesperson told me that 328i was good enough for California Highway, so I didn't get the 335i. The only downturn is that if you drive your car through local road and traffic all the time, it can only give you 15-17 mpg. Hey, I can't complain. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 6 speed 335i ZSP sedan was purchased used as a CPO. The power's nice, the fairly sharp handling is rewarding (nice to be back in RWD) and the is quite cocooned. Large trunk, decent gas mileage and large backseat make it a good family car (wife and infant son). I look forward to curves. Sadly, the vehicle is extremely heavy, the RFTs are lousy and the interior trim appears to be peeling away on the door handle and steering wheel. It's a fun enough car but I look forward to the day I won't need something so large; I'm anxious for BMW to produce a light RWD coupe/sedan. For the next few years the 335i will suffice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolutely the best car I have ever owned. Handles as you would expect for a BMW...like a sports car but also with the luxury you would expect from BMW. This car is FAST...very FAST!!! One must be very careful driving because you can get to 100mph in a heartbeat and it only feels like you're doing 40mph. For a 300hp engine, gets great gas mileage at posted highway speeds (65mph) of somewhere around 29-30mpg. Expect 23-24 mpg in combined highway/city driving. After 14000 miles and 16 months of driving, I have had zero issues requiring any maintenance by the dealership. They did change the oil at one year (11K miles) and the wiper blades but the car has needed no other attention.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At first I was a little skeptical about purchasing a BMW as many reviews including consumer reports stated that the electronics fail often and overall reliability is not as high as other Japanese companies. However when I read about the 335 twin turbo engine I had to take a test drive. My first car was a 2001.5 1.8T Audi with a chip and exhaust. Loved the Audi but once I had 150K miles I sold it and got an Acura. I pledged never to get another non-AWD car again. The Acura was plain boring. Once I drove the 335xi it was obvious that this was a special car. I bought it the same day and traded in my Acura TL. </TEXT>

Second, there's a blind spot on the driver's side, and no matter how I angle my mirrors or slightly cock my head to check for cars, there have been a few close calls. My car now has a screeching noise driving at 10-35 mph! The service dept. says if they can't hear it, they can't fix it.

<TEXT>We replaced our 2004 BMW 330 Ci, 6-speed with the 335i, 6-speed. These two autos have almost nothing in common. Everything that we liked about our '04, has been improved on with the 335i. The 335i handles even better and the acceleration must be experienced to be believed. It reminds me more of a Z4 than a coupe.

<TEXT>I've had my 328xi for a few weeks now. I've been a loyal X5 driver (3 of them!) over the past 10 years. I decided to get better gas mileage and cheaper car payment, but didn't want to sacrifice BMW ride. I've not been disappointed. The car is fun to drive and handles great. Even though it doesn't have the high sight lines of the SUV, the coupe's big doors actually give you a wider field of view. (I'm tall, so I sit back far from the wheel, so even in the X5, I could see the side posts in my blind spot.) The car is light, so the power of the smaller engine feels stroner than the X5. Sure, there's less room all around -- but with the seats folded down, it carries a nice load. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Bluetooth and voice-activated navigaton. The perspective mode for the navigation is so much better than the last BMW system (which only had 2 map modes). Don't let anyone tell you the iDrive system is complicated. If you can operate a cell phone, you'll have no trouble with this.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Rarely in life do I find something that actually exceeds my expectations, which were quite lofty to begin with as this was my mid life, post divorce crisis car I waited for my whole life. I have had problems with the electronics already, namely the speedo which reads WAY too high, some tire monitor and other sensors that mysteriously appear and disappear and an overwhelming heat coming from the foot area. (I had been driving it incredibly hard on some world renowned roads and had to have the air on full on the floor in 50 degree temps to NOT sweat!) BUT.. this car is fantastic. EVERY TIME I get in it I feel great. It is the best driving, quickest car I have ever been in. Period.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Other than the engine and incomparable drive (really you can't explain it) I'd say rain sensing wipers believe it or not. When you are doing 75 in a 35mph recommended curve, you don't want to mess with wipers in a mist. The leather is incredibly soft, brakes are incredible, ergonomics are tops!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A lot of people have and will talk about the 328/335 coupe's superb driving performance on solid pavement. I certainly concur with that. I want to comment on the 328xi's also superb winter performance. It is hard to believe that a sports sedan can be so much fun and perform so safely in such adverse conditions. It is simply fun to drive, all the time. The only thing that holds it back is the depth of the snow because of the low ground clearance. Otherwise, it tracks through curves solidly in slush and snow, stops on slippery surfaces as well as any car could be expected to and just gives you a feeling of confidence. You don't have to give up a sporty BMW just because of the weather.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ordered the car and waited and then - oh my, oh my! WOW!! The engine is so smooth. The leather seats are divine. The iDrive system is easy to use, so I don't know why I've read so many complaints. Step on the gas and it goes... as fast as you want, and faster than you realize. The sound system is much nicer than in my previous car. After 20 years, I gave up driving a manual transmission, and I am thrilled. I bought the car just about fully loaded, and I don't have any regrets. This car is a great combination of style, luxury, and power. My husband tried the backseat during our test drive, and said it's roomy. (He's not a small guy either.) We'd do it all again!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, grace, power, comfort and so much more! The engine is incredible, and very quiet for the power. Brakes give a real sense of stopping power.

<TEXT>I live in a small town in Texas and I was unsure which model to purchase at 48 years old. I settled on the 328xi coupe with 6 speed manual. My dilemmas: 1. Does the 328xi have enough power? Yes, and with the extra safety of the xi it came in handy during last weeks downpour. 2. Will the Sport package with 18s and run flats be rough? Smooth, even on my bumpy road. 3. Will the 6 speed manual be fun or in the way? A blast to drive and the Bluetooth works great for hands free phone. 4. Will the coupe be large enough? I have a 10 year old I take to school and I'm in sales and I have to travel with a few extra bags. I believe that this is the best car for the money with a good size trunk.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first and the last BMW. I had Mercedes cars before (used and couple new ones) and I thought that BMW has a better quality, but this is not the case. I've got my 335i miracle on September 5, 2006 as 2007 model. In two weeks fuel pump went down on a highway road. It took one week to repair. In January 2007 I've got an engine malfunction on the car dashboard. The car dealer reset the light and BMW HQ said too much alcohol in the US gas?? In the same day I've got the light again. Now the car is on my dealer repair shop a second week already and BMW HQ still can?t fix it. One time more of the same light and the car can be classified as lemon!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2006 Lexus IS 250 AWD for the 2007 BMW 328i coupe. The driving dynamics between these two vehicles is incomparable. The BMW truly provides a sense of being connected to the road, endless tourqe curve, and responsive power and stabilty. The hum of the inline 6 on the BMW is music to any enthusiasts ears as soon as he/she pushes the ignition button. It begs the question, "Why pay more, considering the sophistication level of the car's overall design, standard equipment level, driving dynamics, and quality of materials?"</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best mid-life crisis sport sedan I have ever owned and driven! Got the 335i with Sport/Premium/Cold Weather package after being blown away by media praise of its awesome 0-60 stats and overall performance. Every review about it is true. It handles like a go-kart, and when the speedo approaches 80, the car's stability makes it feel like it's only going 40, with more power to spare, even at 1400 rpm, when I'm lugging it in low gear. While the cupholders seem a bit oddly placed, I love the four doors, heated seats, sound system, manual tranny, and interior roominess. If I take out my driver, I can fit my golf bag in the trunk without dropping the split seats. Can't wait to drive it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for about 3 weeks. I recently turned in an 03 Benz E500 after a 4 year relationship. Shopping for a new Benz, I decided to finally drive the other German sedans. Well I have to say, the fun factor pins this car off the scale. After 5 minutes I was sold. No contest in driveability and ride dynamics. The small BMW gives up a modest amount of power and torque to the Benz, but more than makes up for that in driveability. I find myself looking for an excuse to drive! Never felt that way in the Benz. I could have gone for the 335, but the 328 was plenty for me, in addition to getting a bit more mileage and probably saving me some tickets.</TEXT>

I have to check everything out, so I went to drive the jaguar, the mercedes, the cadillac cts, the mitsubishi spyder convertible (which by the way, was the vehicle i really wanted till I sat in the bmw.)

I went up a mountain with easy. I got over 29 mpg on a 180 mile round trip including some stop and go traffic (I did keep it around 70 mph). I get stares from everyone on the road, but the people staring the most are other BMW drivers. I have used the iDrive before and it does take some getting use too, but you will pick it up. I drive a lot at night, so self dimming side mirrors was a must. The 18 inch wheels make it look sweeter, so I recommend the sport pkg. I recommend the Comfort Access (I regret not doing so).</TEXT>

I have had two previous 3 series and this one blows them away. It?s not a slow car, but it?s not a racer either. Put it in drive sport mode and it feels as fast as my G35 coupe I traded it in for. I do think it could use about 15 to 20 more ft/lbs of torque though. My past experience with BMWs is that they get much faster as they break in. The 2007 model has 15 more HP and ft/lbs torque than the 2006 model.</TEXT>

It has exceeded my expectations. My husband loves it too, and he is not a car person. One thing I am surprised by is that it is more refined feeling than my old BMW. I like the new cupholders. I wish dealers were not trying to make these into lame cars for incapable people by stocking them with navigation and automatic transmissions. I had to special order my car 2 months ago to get a manual coupe, sport pkg, in alpine white. Those options, IN A BMW, call for a special order! This is ridiculous, America! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the seat belt valet. Sport seats are great; driving quality is great. I am also glad I didn't pay $2k extra for the leather - the leatherette is gorgeous, and some Montana cows were saved. The leather on my last BMW didn't wear well despite treatments.</FAVORITE>

This car will sell itself if you can get to the dealership and test drive one. This is my 3rd style BMW and by far this is the biggest jump in style and performance from its previous generation. The only thing I didn't like is you don't have the option to buy the car with normal tires. The only option - run flats, and you can never repair them. Everytime you have even a slow leak with a runflat you have to buy a new one and if you decide to put normal tires on, there's no room for a spare.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Active Steering is one of the biggest differences I've noticed so far. The automatic tranny with the paddle shifters is excellent, It makes this car extremely fun to drive. AND the comfort access option,with the key in your pocket the doors unlock as you walk up to the car, and you can start it also</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is completely addictive, from the noise it makes, through the shove-in-the back acceleration to the informative feel of the controls. I did not know that driving could become so entertaining again, and that after a day in the office I would look forward to the process of commuting home. It looks gorgeous too, and is full of smart features (some rather over-thought) but many more useful than one would expect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had driven a 330xi for the past 6 years and loved the car. It had excellent acceleration and a great feel. The new 328xi is supposed to have more torque and horsepower but has absolutely no acceleration. The car is slow from standing to 1st and lags from 1st to 2nd. It bucks on me when going up a hill. I can feel the slow shifting in the low gears and when I make a right or left turn from a stopping position, the car haltingly moves. I am shocked at the lack of responsiveness of this car. I don't know whether I have a bad model or whether this car is simply grossly underpowered. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a 3-series nut. I previously owned a 2001 330ci, then a 2002 M3 Convertible. The 330ci was a bit too slow. The M3 was fast, but too harsh to be comfortable. The new 335i coupe is a perfect combination... it is as fast as (dare I say FASTER than?) the M3, but far more comfortable. It looks and feels incredibly classy, handles extremely well, is the perfect size, is fairly economical (I'm averaging 19 mpg in combined driving), and really isn't all that expensive considering minivans now cost nearly $40k. The 335i is by FAR the best combination of sport, comfort, and beauty. I am shocked at how much I love my new 335i. I also suspect that these cars will hold their values very well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is very comfortable and roomy. Comfort access is great (key stays in pocket - just hit the Start button!), rain-sensing wipers standard. Silent, comfortable highway ride yet blistering back-road handling and acceleration. Also, it is a beautiful car, very classy looking.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased 2007 335 Sedan w/ Spt./Prm./Sat/Auto. Incredible car. Keep in mind that the sedan is the same body style as 2006, only visual difference is the badge and dual exhaust tips. It will absolutely rocket. Have owned an M3, Benz 230K, and BMW 328. This car is equal to a current M3 in my opinion as far as acceleration and handling. There is no other car in this class that can compare with this degree of power, handling, interior and exterior style. Bluetooth is awesome feature. Stereo fabulous. Have kids so must have the sedan. Actually, I like the rear-end on the sedan better than the coupe. Incredible car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a car! I have owned a 325iC, X5, X3, 328i, but I have to say this is the best BMW that I have ever owned. It is just so much fun to drive. Great acceleration, handling around the bends. If you are going to buy the 3 series coupe you have to get the stick, just adds another level of fun to the overall experience. I have been told by my passengers that it is fun even in the passenger seat. The blue tooth works great and sounds great. I love the automatic seat belts. Interior design is just awesome. I have two kids, 14 and 11 and they love the back seat, very comfortable. Haven't had a chance to drive the car in the snow but I am looking forward to that opportunity. Great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is everything wonderful about a BMW taken to an incredible level. The driving experience alone is a value at this price, and it's wrapped in what is finally a slam dunk iteration of the new Bangle styling.

My car is fully loaded. The only option I did not order was the window shades. All I do is drive. The other nitty-gritty details like wipers coming on when they have to, slowing down when approaching a slow moving car, opening doors without keys, getting directions are all taking care of by the car's huge brain.

<TEXT>Having driven 2 new M5s in the last 6 years and a 645i, it is difficult to find the words to describe how powerful and thrilling it is to drive the new 335i Sedan. The engine is a masterpiece running sub-5 0-60 and getting nearly 30 mpg on the freeway! Steering is precise, braking exceptional and suspension tight with a great exhaust note. In addition, the interior is comfortable, seats the best in any 3 series ever and the fit and finish are excellent. Exterior styling could be further distinguished (the only obvious difference bet the 335 and other models are the dual exhausts). The coolest feature may be the real time traffic right on the nav screen either on the map route or in text form</TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I wanted the 2006 330i sedan and began the process of selection a year and a half ago. After awaiting the 2006 new model I decided that I would wait awhile longer for the coupe to appear. Am I glad I did! Wow it has proven to be worth the wait. I am thrilled with the style, comfort and performance of my Montego Blue Metallic 2007 335ci. My concern was always comfort with the 3-series which is why I didn't accept in in the early 2000 models but this car is so roomy (I am 6 feet tall and 215 pounds). Everything about it is first class. The interior devices are all within reach, the moving parts work well and the comfort is without flaw. What a great product from BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I currently drive a 2003 Audi A4 3.0 quattro. Today I test-drove the 335i coupe with premium and sport pkgs (manual transmission), and this is going to be my next car. The power was incredible, and reminded me of the 97 M3 I used to drive. The brakes were also M3-like. However, the ride was not - it was beautiful: smooth, quiet, firm but not punishing. It was my opinion of perfect balance between performance and comfort. This car is FUN!! I no longer dream of purchasing an S4 or M3.</TEXT>

I compared it to the Lexus IS 350 which i think is the closest rival. Lexus has a better interior for my taste and both appeal to me exteriorly but the difference is the handling. BMW really hugs the road and you can feel like you really are a part of the car. BMW made me agree that it is the ultimate driving machine.

<TEXT>Bought my 335i after begging my wife to drive her 535i for 6 months. I chose the sedan over the coupe because I do have people in the backseat frequently. The car drives like a rocket on wheels. Fast, but also very smooth and refined in most driving situations. It is the only car I have owned in 45 years of driving that excites me every time I start it, even after a year's ownership. An unexpected plus has been the gas mileage. It has consistently delivered 22+MPG city and 30 on highway cruises. It has been extraordinarily reliable with only routine dealer visits all covered under warranty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The premium package gives me plenty of luxury and features, but I also got navigation and Sirius radio. These are a must for long distance driving. The iDrive, which is frequently maligned, is not that hard to master and offers amazing control of all the car's features without a lot of buttons.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased as CPO, was a dealer loaner. Drive is generally good and it looks and feels like a BMW. Performance off the line in regular automatic is poor, but sport or manual mode makes it feel much better. Brakes and cornering are very good, but the trade off is a bit of a rough ride, especially over long distances. Fuel economy is about 23 mpg combined city/highway. Interior features are good and feels spacious, except that radio stack cannot be seen with sunglasses on. We also had a random failure of one of the side mirror covers on the highway, when the plastic part just fell off and was replaced under warranty. If you can get a good deal its a good solid car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car looks great, top up or down. It?s quiet. You can have a normal conversation even with the top down. It has a comfortable cockpit feel and is fun to drive. My biggest complaint is the Run Flat Tires. My car has the sport package with different size tires on the back. Picking up a small nail at 800 miles, I learned that BMW and Firestone would not repair it, a new tire cost $350 plus and neither had it in stock. The car does not come with a spare or a jack. If you get a flat, pray that you?re close to home because you can only drive 50 miles and then you are stuck, probably for days. I bought a spare wheel and tire. With a second flat at 4000 miles, I put regular tires on.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Other small pros- 1) I recommend the ?convenient access? just for fun. 2) The ?adaptive head light and the rain sensor are also fun. 3) Easy top operation with no problems so far. 4) Good highway gas mileage. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted to try the BMW and was impressed with the 335i advertised horsepower and torque. But I didn't really notice the turbo lag on the test drive when I bought the car. Now 2 years later I can't wait to turn this vehicle in. It has been back to the dealer 3 times for performance and I am always told this is normal. It is extremely irritating and dangerous. Try to pull out in traffic or try to go when it is your turn at a 4 way stop and you will have a one second delay from the time you hit the gas until it goes. Then it jerks as the traction control goes on and off. I have had the brake sensors replaced and the steering column. Stay away from this car. Poor quality and performance. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Extremely slow steering for a bmw. It takes so much cranking of the wheel just to make a simple turn, and on top of that the effort is really heavy. And they don't offer active steering in xi models. The bridgestone runflats are joke. A fairly quick stop will make them slide. Starting from a stop is jarring. Press the gas in automatic mode and it will first pause for a while and then buck and jerk while it decides if it should continue in second gear or downshift to first. It goes through coolant and oil pretty quickly. Much faster than scheduled maintenance happens. Oh, and forget about spirited driving without sports package..there is NO seat bolstering whatsoever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the styling and the car proved to be a joy to drive... until I got my software updated. Instead of boost coming on before 2k RPM as advertised, there is now a significant amount of turbo lag. BMW has altered the performance of my car without my permission, possibly to minimize wear and warranty issues with the turbos. Until this problem is resolved, I would NOT recommend a 335. </TEXT>

The twin-turbo engine gives 0-60 mph in less than 5 seconds then you realize you are way above the speed limit. Rear seating lacks leg room but any who buys the 3-series coupe for its leg room? I've heard enough complaints out there about the infamous iDrive but who cares if you can simply use your voice to control everything? I don't recommend getting the beige interior as it gets dirty too easily. All in all, this is one fine piece of German engineering. 7 out of 10 overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this beauty and love the car. The only problem we have is that the convertible top is not working like it suppose to. It has been in the shop 4 times since we purchased the vehicle. The first time it was a computer chip where they literally had to take out the back seat. Then it was another computer glitch and now the top when it is closed makes noises. The runflats I am not impressed, the ride is rough when you hit a bump and then the tire light comes on. Other then that we love the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is definitely a head turner We love the navigation system, all though it is not as good as our Garmin in the other car. The Sirius radio and the SOS button.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased my 328xi coupe about 20 months ago. I have not had a single regret. Awesome driving, comfort, power, styling, and not too bad fuel economy for the rewarding performance. I calculated my fuel consumption and it was 22 mpg combined. my commute includes highway and inner city driving and I like to use the SD and M modes a lot too. The more power of the 335 would probably be even more fun, but for a first time BMW owner, I am more than happy. But what I was truly impressed by is the 4-wheel drive on the snow. I live in Ohio and my 328 had no trouble cruising on snow when other "larger" 4X4s were slipping and skidding beside me! Note: get the 4-season tires, not the Performance tires.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Bridgestone run-flats are a definite fault for my 2007 328i sedan - - noisy, premature wear at 15K miles, overall poor performance. BMW should make buyers aware of the "replacement before $20,000 half-price discount" (why so secretive????); but even more so should get rid of them altogether. Very poor choice for a luxury sedan. BMW should listen to their consumers and ditch the RFTs. This is my third 3 series though the first with RFTs, but will be my last if BMW sticks with the run-flats. Other than this one complaint, I love the car. Considering putting regular radials on it and putting a compact spare/jack in the trunk! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Notwithstanding the following, the 328 Touring is great automobile, but in the hopes that these comments may come to BMW's attention, here are five criticisms: 1) the rear hatch requires some effort to open; 2) the direction signal is overly electronic and can miss the off position; 3) the radio control is based on some old DOS format and is awkward to change from cd to tuner; 4) the car produces a large clunk over potholes; 5) the transmission spends so much time seeking gas savings it's slow to down shift (and the sport mode is way too nervous). These should be all easy to correct. But perhaps most disturbing is that the car's ride is drifting towards that of Lexus and away from BMW.</TEXT>

This is the first BMW I have owned and never really considered one before this model because they just didn't ring any bells. Drove one on the way to buy another updated Merc C class at Xmas and was smitten. The car is great and I am really pleased with it, and very, very surprised at how good it is.

After its fifth time in the shop, went to close the door and the whole panel popped off. The problems never stopped until I traded it in for an Audi A4 two months later which made me much happier.

<TEXT>I love this car. I wanted a wagon for the extra room, but I wasn't going to compromise handling or fuel economy getting a crossover SUV. I like to test drive cars and have test driven a lot. I was ready to buy another Passat wagon (I loved every 100000 miles I put on my original), but then I test drove a 3 series - it was all over. There was no comparison with any other car that I have driven. Somehow they have combined the handling and comfortable ride like nothing I've ever driven. Good MPG. I took a 600 mile trip through mountains. Driving in the 80 range no cruise got 26. Before the mountains, rolling hills, some towns, cruise set mostly around 65 I got 30, everyday combination 24.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling plus the comfortable ride. I love the styling. The best looking sport wagon on the planet. The all wheel drive.

<TEXT>I've had my car 8 months, and done a few 12 hours road trips. Great car to drive, smooth, economical for the performance, fast and responsive. Generally a quiet and comfortable car, though the cabin noise above 100+ mph is a bit high - not sure if that's the tires, or that it's just our highways in the midwest really aren't built to be driven at that speed. Steptronic is nice, but occasional problem jerking when accelerating from a dead stop. Also tested an auto Infiniti G35x but no comparison. 26-27 mpg on highway, average about 19mpg but I drive a lot of start/stop in Chicago, and it's hard not to gun the engine!</TEXT>

<TEXT>All around this has been a great car for the past year. It has averaged 21 MPG with a 65% city 35% freeway driving mix, and that is with some spirited driving on many occassions. On a recent road trip (400 miles) I averaged nearly 30 MPG. So to get that kind of MPG from a car that has 300 HP, 300 lb-feet of torque and can 0-60 in 5.5 seconds is amazing! One complaint has been the runflat tires (Bridgestone Potenzas.) They tramline, ride harsh and don't have the best traction. If I MUST have runflats, the Michelin Pilot Sport ZP would be a better choice. Overall, the car has been nearly flawless and completely reliable. My mirrors have a memory setting problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Loved BMW since a little kid, finally got one. Even entry level 328i has plenty of power and sticks to the road like glue. Many people warned me that they don't handle well in snow/ice, but I found it to be better than any car I've ever had (including front wheel drives). I couldn't make it skid when I tried. Glad I didn't go for the "x" option, unnecessary. The car is quality through and through. Wish I had an autobahn to really run it! May do European delivery next time.</TEXT>

Though it is not anywhere near the top in term of horsepower count, power delivery is excellent, making highway passing and merging very easy. Fuel economy is surprisingly good for a car that offers such performance. Unlike many other V6s, real life MPG is pretty close to what is shown on the sticker.

It turns corners just a good as the sedan. Looks great and the sunroof is wonderful in place of my droptop I traded. The wagon is a better deal than an SUV for gas mileage and getting around town. More headroom than the sedan in the rear. Great car for older folks vs. the minivan look. Provides extra space in the rear with the split seats for getting back and forth from shopping. </TEXT>

I have had the car for a little over a year (9K) and have had an oil sensor glitch and a rear lamp failure, which was covered by the warranty. BMW touts free 4-year maintenance, which says an oil change every 15K, that seems crazy to me, so I recommend servicing the car at least once between the free ones.

With manual, sport, and "D" modes to choose from, and quick shifting, it is exceptionally competent and fun. It doesn't hurt that the massive torque is available at almost any RPM, so acceleration is strong in any gear. The run flat tires are a mixed bag--I like the safety feature but don't care for the harsher ride and potential expense to replace.</TEXT>

It has the raw power of my old V8 camero, and sticks to the road like my 300Z - the best of both worlds. Almost all the cars on the lots were auto, and all had the premium package. We ordered ours from the factory in Germany in order to get a 6 speed manual gearbox with all the sport options and very little of the "premium" options (no i-drive, thank goodness). It arrive in 5 weeks. It feels like we got a production M3 right of the box! We have had it for almost 7 months now and its still a thrill. </TEXT>

I have the 335 with the manual transmission and I just love every minute of it. Any 3 series will give you all the driving enjoyment you'll need or at least an understanding of why BMW is so special. The twin turbo 335 in addition to the manual transmission will just add to that experience. The aftermarket is also full of many performance mod's that can easily make this car have between 350 to 400 HP or more. The 300 HP stock rating is definitely under-rated to begin with, so don't compare numbers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After coming from my previous E46 3-series, the current 3 feels like the best yet. The 335 engine is worth the extra money, hands-down. The power is truly amazing. It's slightly larger than previous 3s, but I suppose BMW is making room in the line-up for the 1-series. Fit and finish are impressive, as always. The car is literally an extension of your body when driving -- extremely intuitive and responsive. Some downsides include reliability (minor issues mainly), run flat tires, slow responsiveness of iDrive and Comfort Access at times, poorly placed window controls (too far away), and quirky voice recognition.</TEXT>

I took ED delivery in July and we had a once in a lifetime expereince driving through the Alps and Italy. It is now home and over Thanksgiving it had its first long trip of 1,200m RT. Although it is technically a very sophisticated car, with heaps of electronic gadgetry - I have iDrive - it all works as advertised. I even lowered the top on I-95 in stopped traffic. Needless to say, it is fast and performs very well. And it is quiet cruising at 100 as if it were a coupe. Gas mileage isn't bad either, getting 23 mpg in a mix of suburban and high speed driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have stayed away from BMWs for the last 5 years due to dissatisfaction with local dealerships and overall BMW attitude to customers. I was lured back by the 335's promise of M3 like performance with more pleasant manners as a daily driver, for a lot less money. I was initially a bit disappointed as the car is heavier and less responsive than my old E46 328. I have since replaced the stock suspension with PSS9 coilovers and ditched the RFTs and put wider tires on front. It's a completely different car, and handles like a BMW should. It's hard to beat as an all round car with room for four. Most drivers will be happy with the stock performance, but it can be substantially improved.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A great looking car. It's a blast to drive. Unlimited acceleration. Almost feels like a go cart. Love the ability to unlock the car and start it w/o taking keys out of my pocket. Seats not great for the bigger body as they are heavily bolstered. Don't buy this car if you drive almost exclusively in heavy traffic. When you can't enjoy its potential, it's just another car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Twin turbo engine. Very strong braking. External looks. The iDrive - once you master it, it is quite good. Don't believe all the negative criticism about it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought an early 2007 328xi. I have about 17k miles on the car now and it's been a great car. Zero mechanical problems. It has great acceleration for day-to-day driving, and sport mode when you need to merge. Major downsides are (1) gas mileage (20-22 in mixed driving; no where near the EPA estimate), (2) noise from the runflats (the loaner I had for my 1 year service was quieter, which leads me to believe that these tires get louder with age). I also had some paint peeling from the interior driver's side door handle. Apparently almost everyone experiences this. BMW replaced it in an hour, no questions asked. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling. Acceleration. The standard lighting package (the LEDs under the grab handles, the lights under the doors, the footwell lights, etc.).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I landed a new job, I wanted something fun that could turn heads, I chose the perfect car. I got the 335i, grey on red leather. Fast, agile, sleek, what is there not to love? Because I traded in the 10 year-old Mercedes Benz diesel, I would never look at anything else. I get compliments almost every single day because of the lines this car has, I now get parked in front of the restaurant by valet. If you are looking at it, buy it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is stunningly beautiful. Power of the 3.0 liter rivals a V-8. Fuel economy surprised me, 25 in town and 32 on the highway. No negatives after a year of driving. It handles so great on the road. No body sway at all on sharp turns. Handling is a dream.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the comfort access. Never have to reach for a key. Rear Window shade helps a lot here in Florida. The iDrive not as bad as some say. Took a short time to get accustomed to it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently traded my Volvo S60 2.5T for the 328i and couldn't be more pleased. This car has great power, excellent handling and an understated luxury that I find very attractive. Over the years I've driven Mercedes, Saab, the Volvo and a couple of high-end Japanese cars. The BMW outperforms them all. The Volvo may be famous for its passive safety features, but the active safety of the BMW is a clear winner. To quote the BMW manual "Everything Under Control." </TEXT>

<TEXT>Since my purchase, I have had no remorse in my choosing the 335xi - the car is a dream in handling and response. I like having the added safety of all wheel drive on wet pavement. The iDrive was a little difficult to learn at first, but now I can easily (and safely) maneuver and the voice commands also work without problems. The gas mileage between highway and city is averaging about 21 mpg. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the rain sensing wipers - I don't have to keep adjusting the speed to the weather conditions. The ability to get a boost in sport drive with the automatic is great for quick passing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have never owned a car that turns heads the way this one does. Put the top up or down at a stop light and watch the looks. I have even heard "I gotta get me one of those". This is still a new car and only has a few thousand miles on it so far. To say that it is fun to drive is an understatement. This was a gift for my wife and it was a home run. We have the atlantic blue, a new color with the cream interior... stunning. The only problems I have had so far were self induced, but after reading the manual all were solved. I must have a Wednesday car because the workmanship is outstanding. Unbelieveably quiet with the hard top up. Great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Blk/Blk, sport,prem,nav,ipod. This is one of the most fun cars to drive that I've owned. It has amazing torque and sticks to corners without roll. I'm a previous 5 series owner so it feels a little cramped inside. Extremely disappointed with BMW, as the vehicle left me on the expressway with only 480 miles on it and the SOS service was horrible. The vehicle connected well with the call service, however, the AAA srvc provider BMW uses did not pick up my car for 4 hours (and it was 100 degrees in Atl). Complained to BMW NA but they didn't care. Problem was the belts broke and the car lost all power. Gas mileage is good for a 300 hp car, avg 22.5 mpg. Would get 535i next time for space.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Torque and acceleration! Great stereo... subwoofers provide deep bass, finally. Navigation system is very good and Sirius service makes for a good companion on long commutes. Power folding mirrors are a plus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 328xi has the premium, sport, and cold weather packages, and it is also a manual. It's a great car. The run flat tires are hard for Michigan roads, but I've had no problems otherwise. The accelerator pedal (electronic, I suspect) is a bit dead, but the rest of the controls are great. There is no on-the-road performance hit compared to the sedan or coupe. I considered and test drove them all. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Utility (my folding kayak fits inside), and the awd (though torque steer is present), BMW service both from the dealer and the company are great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I waited a long time for just the right BMW, AWD 6-speed manual stylish coupe, and couldn't be happier. A perfect daily driver for my needs. Always fun. Superb on two long highway trips so far. Great combination of exhilarating when pushed and serene when cruising. Unbelievable cornering forces generated even with the lowly Conti all-season run-flats. Completely predictable handling always. Firm ride is OK but big bumps cause a resounding whack when suspension bottoms - avoid potholes. Upgrade sound system is worth it - best I have heard. Bluetooth works great. Very little wind noise or buffeting with sunroof and windows open. Beautiful engine. Notchy shifter improving a bit with break-in.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Suspension - typical BMW - world-class ride/hanling compromise. Sound system - great and distortion-free at high volumes with all types of music. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Can?t be too harsh on critique with so much to praise on performance. Low end torque is all I need. With steering that turns like a sticky roller coaster, a warp drive tranny alone in its own universe, and all the speed you need, This thing is really the best. But sacrifice for the privilege. True cost to own is double that of a Mini and you must be able to drop it off at the dealer regularly without a grimace. I have been in for repair a few times and will go back again while trying to remain calm. After owning for 6 months, the inconvenience is now starting to outweigh the fading thrill.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had problem from day 1 with vibration when releasing clutch in 5th. Dealer replaced tranny/clutch/transfer case, problem still persits. Car was at dealer 28 out of first 51 days. Dealer was very supportive. They paid my first month's lease payment. BMW and dealer came through today and are going to replace the car with a 2008 model. I'm going in to order it tomorrow. Even swap, and lease stays the same. Verdict still out on run flat tires. Happy with the fit and finish and performance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handles like no other car I've driven. Love to push it through the turns. Navigation system takes some getting used to but once you get it it's great. iPod adaptor.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My previous car was a 2001 AUDI A6 4.2 pearl color. I loved it and thought there was no match. I was wrong. The BMW 335xi is a great car with plenty of power and looks. I settled for a Titanium Silver with all of the trimmings. (Premium, Sport, etc.) Good MPG 26-27 highway will be saving me a little cash too. For those shopping, don't short change yourself, be sure to get the premium package at minimum, you'll want to sleep in your car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport package looks change the whole appearance of the car. </FAVORITE>
