<TEXT>We bought our 2007 Equinox brand new, noticed a smell and inside windows kept fogging up this summer. Found that our carpet in the back was completely soaked with water. By the time we found the issue, our carpets had a black mold on them. I have a small child who is a severe asthmatic and I feel this is a safety issue. Our Equinox is currently back at the dealership for recurrent leaks. So far the dealership can't figure out the source of the leak, so AGAIN I am in limbo, renting a car, hopefully it won't take 6 weeks, like the first time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is roomy with my 2 small kids</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the exterior my 2007 Equinox. XM radio is a great feature. However interior is full of issues. Heated seats work intermittently. Don't wait until winter to try them. You might be out in the cold. This feature isn't for the duration of the 5 yr, 100,000 mile warranty. Check them throughout the year even in the summer. Right passenger airbag sensor doesn't always work. GM recall for this. Driver side seat mechanism didn't work once for 2 days. Took it to dealership to fix. Chrome center panel reflects sun causing blinding glare when driving. Remember some things are only under warranty for 2 years so don't delay taking your car in for repairs. Make sure it's in computer system everytime</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car when i was pregnant. The headrest is a vision blocker when trying to look in the blind spots(the tiny windows in the back) The seats are now as hard as bleachers think it's causing my back problems. The plastic dash board and steering wheel are So hard to clean. Not to mention that the trim around the shifter is a huge chrome piece that of course the sun hits and blinds you while you are driving. This could cause an accident. Bought brand new in '07' still haven't reached the gas mileage that it's supposed to be getting and i do a lot of highway driving, when bought it got 16MPGs, now only at 18.3MPGs. HHMM! Sound system?? WHAT HAPPENED!!! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The all wheel drive is the only thing i like. Gets around great in the snow and ice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a small SUV for quite awhile. I had my mind set on a Mitsubishi Outlander but during my test drives, I tried a 2006 Equinox and was impressed with the handling. I disliked the interior of the 2006, so I tried the 2007. I was impressed with the interior upgrades (new for that year) and the $ was right! The cabin is extremely quiet, the engine (3.4 V6) is adequate for size of the vehicle. The steering does feel somewhat numb-it wasn't a deal breaker for me. The back seat is VERY roomy and slides back & forth - convenient for parents with little ones or if you need additional cargo room without putting the seats down. I feel I got alot for my $ - so far!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet cabin, Trip computer./Driver Information Center, AWD, Feels safe and interior is roomy & comfortable. Exterior/Interior is very appealing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought it because our family was growing and we needed a little extra room for the family car. We've been really pleased with how well its done so far. We recently took a roadtrip to the mountains and I averaged 28 MPG with the AC on. Usually I get 21-22 in the city. Just a few downsides. So far, we are pleased with the purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to admit, this is a nice looking vehicle but UNRELIABLE. This is my daughter's car and there have been 5+ times the vehicle would not start. The key would even get stuck in the ignition. Unfortunately, recently, we have found out this is not uncommon. Our dealership service dept is great but can't find out what the problem is, although they have done some repairs. Also headlight has blown twice. Definitely a cheap feeling vehicle to match the price, does accelerate well. I have had 3 trailblazers and there is no comparison. Would not downgrade that far. The ride is comparable to the Ford Escort. The equinox is a disposable vehicle. Come on Chevy, you gotta beef it up. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owner over 30 cars and don't give praises lightly, however, I have been very happy with this vehicle. I traded in an '05 Trailblazer because it was woefully underpowered, but have been extremely pleased by the pep in my Equinox. The 6 cyl. is more than enough power. When I park next to the Lexus Crossover, I have trouble telling them apart and cannot for the life of me imagine what features I am missing for an additional $20k. My Equinox is fully loaded and with the OnStar GPS system, the vehicle has everything I could need. It drives great on the highway where I average over 24 MPG, and get around 22 MPG around town. I strongly recommend it to anyone who asks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been problem free for the last 22 months I have owned it. For the price I think there is no better riding small to mid-sized SUV on the market. I?ve had gas mileage up to 26 on a mixed driving. Quiet and smooth ride. The AWD works well on snow and ice. It is well worth the 28k I paid. Only complaint is no overhead grab bars. For those who think GM can?t make a car, please go out and drive one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Equinox brand new with 0 miles in Feb 07- coming up on 2 yrs of owning it I still have mixed feelings. It handles horribly in the snow, even with the AWD feature. Its been extremely reliable other than 2 factory recalls (winshield & airbag) the stereo isnt that great, buttons are breaking off, engine knocks even w/ regular oil changes. It has a hard time getting up steep country hills. Very sleek vehicle. Its black. Decent gas milage. Needs a bigger trunk and the hatch is heavy and slow to open. Its ok for now but I'm already looking at buying something else for winter. Its good for summer driving. I wouldnt purchase another. I think its too costly for the quality of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall I am well satisfied with my Equinox having owned it for over a year. Have had no mechanical problems yet. Very comfortable and good on long road trips. Gas mileage good on highway-not so good around town. 17 inch Bridgestone tires will hydroplane in a heartbeat in heavy rain. Scary! Interior planning could be better. Rear seat doesn't fold flat and front cupholder interferes with hand brake. Rear cargo curtain is a joke. Don't waste your money buying it. Decent vehicle so far, but still not the quality of my 2000 Volvo. Detroit still can't get it right. </TEXT>

<TEXT>May 2008 has just been a year from the purchase of my truck. It is great! Very roomy in the inside and a lot of lerg room in the back seat. Lots of cargo space. It doesn't seem that big from the outside but when you get in, it's big. It was enough room for a third row in the back. I love my truck and thank God he blessed me with it and it was brand new with 0 miles when I purchased it. It's just a gas guzzler to me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car when changing positions to sales from engineering. I work for a company that builds light-weight campers and I needed something that would pull up to 3500#. The Equinox does a great job and my gas mileage is very impressive. It is a great looking vehicle with somewhat futuristic looks and it compliments the unusual campers we build. Without having any trailering experience to speak of, I have successfully navigated over 10,000 miles with ease. On one of my trips I left 11:30 at night in a storm with 2" of snow already on the ground while towing a 1600# camper. The traction control was awesome even through the winding mountainous back roads of Western Pennsylvania. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage. Up to 29.4 on highways at +70 mph. Gas mileage while towing: between 15.8 to 23.7 depending on many variables. It's a comfortable ride with predictable handling. I love the stereo too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have owned the Equinox for 6 months now and all in all is a great value. We purchased an '07 1LT with the 17" chrome wheels, which make it look great. I like the sporty look, ride and handling, but, im not that impressed with the gas mileage, I get the same mileage with a 2000 grand cherokee as this. I also hate the recessed windshield, it is a pain in the rear to brush snow off, my hood is scratched and chipped after one winter. </TEXT>

It was my boyfriend's he loved it but wanted bigger so I got a hand me down this cars a year old with a little over 13,000 miles on it! I love it drives smooth runs great looks great and is better on gas then my Neon was. My sister owns one and she loves it. My boyfriends co worker has one loves it. If your looking for a spacious reliable SUV this is it! Excellent buy. It's worth every penny I bought it for!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had to get a new car when my old one got totaled. I knew I wanted a SUV but i didn't know what. I found my car I took it on 2 test drives, and I fell in love with it. I love how high it sits up im short so that makes a big difference. When it's time to get another vehice it will definitely be looking for another Equinox. I also like how well priced they are!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the look of the exterior. It still has a sporty look to it. I really like how it will tell you your tire pressure and when you need an oil change. The leg room in the back is very good. But my favorite thing is how it tells you how many miles to empty!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a totally under-rated and ignored crossover. Easily the best vehicle I have ever owned. Versatility unmatched by any other competing small SUV. The Edmunds review of the Equinox is more favorable than most. The highest praise I can give is that very soon our '07 LT will be joined in the garage by an '08 Sport.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG is fantastic. 23-24 around, with 26 attainable on long highway trips, including 3 adults and a dog on a holiday trip to Las Vegas. Absolute comfortable seating and easy to use controls. The OnStar, a feature not available on any competition is worth every penny. Pioneer sound system is great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were forced to purchase a new car after the Jeep dealer ruined our 05 Jeep Liberty. We really did not want to be in the market for a car and yet here we were. We began my search in the beginning of September and wanted to get a year end deal on a 2007 model. After reviewing a number of models, we settled on the Pontiac Torrent. Although, this was the first choice, we gravitated to the Equinox as we could not find a Torrent with the equipment desired. However, if we could have assembled the car ourselves we would have put the Torrent front on the Equinox rear. Since purchased we put on about 4,400 trouble free miles.

<TEXT>Looked for a long time before settling on the Nox. Thought I wanted a car after driving a 2 WD pickup for 10 years. Took the Nox for a spin on a whim one day and was surprised by the ride and how quiet it was. Found this one at a rental outlet with 20K on it and I've put on 2K. So far its been reliable and very comfortable on my 25 mile commute. There have been a couple of snowy, icy days here in CO that I have been very glad to have the AWD, it handles great in the snow. Not happy with the mileage, averaging 20 or so in mixed highway/city.</TEXT>

It is very quick for a six cylinder. Handles great and is fun to drive. We don't regret giving up Caddy because the Equinox is just as comfortable. Last thing, the heated seats are a must for the North Central part of the country, you will not regret it! I would definitly buy another Equinox. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first SUV-AWD. I looked at the Ford Escape, CRV, RAV4 and Torrent. The Equinox was far better both in looks and in value. Way better looking! Pretty and sporty! The Torrent was nice looking too, but what about that name? Anyway Equinox is a great car. Really comfortable and just feels good on my back and neck and overall posture when I'm driving. Perfect height to get in & out of - don't have to climb in like a full size 4x4, or drop down into like a car. Had "check engine" light issues when I first got the car. It took three trips to the dealer but they finally got it right - the gas cap was a bad fit so if you have the same issue get that cap checked out right away. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Both my husband and I drive approx 600 each week. So we each wanted a low cost vehicle with decent gas mileage and comfort. We found this in the Equinox so we bought two. I traded in my 2005 outback on the two vehicles. Although, the subaru is a real fun car to drive, it was not comfortable. The Equinox is comfort almost as fun to drive and gets good gas mileage. I'd recommend this vehicle for a young family or older folk, like me, with not so a pliable body but wants the best buy for the money. GM has a hit with this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving for 40 years and had about as many cars and trucks in that time with this being my first SUV. The closest thing I owned previous was a Chevy van with the same engine which is one reason I knew I would like it. The engine is powerful yet delivers great mileage for a vehicle of this size. Running it hard around a major city shows close to 19 MPG with highway running 70-75 mph 24 MPG. Thanks to the 5 Speed. The ride is what I really enjoy, smooth, real smooth and quiet. I bought it for the Pittsburgh winters and long commute I make into the snow belt north of here plus the space to carry my wife's wheelchair with room left for other passengers which it does with ease.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently went out and traded in my Trailblazer SS for a new Equinox and I am very impressed. The gas mileage in this thing is phenominal for an SUV (that's not a hybrid). I travel a lot for work so I have had many chances to get a feel for it and I really like it. My wife also likes it. The ride is very comfortable and is almost ideal for long trips. For those of you who like to ride high but also want good gas mileage and a comfortable ride, this is the one for you! I wish I would have got the AWD but my gas mileage would have suffered. Also 17" rims are very nice a attractive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at many SUV's and always came back to the Equinox. We purchased an AWD with 3LT pkg. With the chrome clad wheels and leather, everyone thinks we paid thousands more. It is my wife's car and just the right size to get around in. She feels very safe and secure in it. The AWD worked well in our Minnesota winter and the stability control took over when I tried to spin out. We also have a great local dealer. </TEXT>

The StabiliTrak? is standard on the 2007 model which is great for handling the vehicle on highway ramps and other tight turns. My Mother has said that it drives very smoothly and has great handling with the StabiliTrak? feature. However my Mother has complained about the wide turns and the location of the hand brake.

<TEXT>I bought my Equinox just two months ago. I have a horrible experience with it so far. Just after two months (3000km) loud noise appeared in drive side front wheel bearing. It's high pitched humming noise, very loud and unbearable after just cuple minutes of driving. Even more frustrating was dealing with GM warranty service. They did't have bearing assembly to replace, it had to be ordered and I'm still awaiting for it (3 weeks passed already). GM doesn't provide replacement car and I have to drive Equinox with faulty bearing. It is become a torture - noise getting more and more unbearable. I had to cancel my travel plans, limit my driving to minimum. Fuel consumption is very high - horrible </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2004 Nissan Xterra for the 2007 Equinox. The Equinox has much more interior room both in the front and rear seat and being over 6 foot tall I was surprised by the rear seat leg room. The ride is smooth and comfortable and compares favorably to my Nissan Altima. The gas mileage has been as advertised. It has so much more get up and go compared to the Xterra.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is great for mid-size SUV which can also tow 3500 pounds. Other SUVs, that get similiar gas mileage, could only tow 1000-2000 pounds. Exterior looks great. Ride is very comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This SUV shouldn't be in a class with the Ford Escape and smaller SUVs. It's remarkably spacious, it looks great, and there's so many options you can get. I got the base model, added great leather, dark tint, remote start, bluetooth, and rims. I liked it this way so I would only pay for what I wanted. First ever SUV and I'm loving it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite features are the information center, the stereo looks great, and the room still blows my mind. The ride is smooth, quiet, and powerful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this vehicle after test driving the Saturn Vue. It has more interior space and looks better.

<TEXT>This SUV is fun to drive. Came out of a Ford Escape XLT 3.0 liter lease and was looking at another one when we test drove the Equinox to the Ford Dealer. My wife drives this 99% of the time. She fell in love with this SUV. Did a ton of research on the Equinox and got great feedback from others who have them. Saved some money by going with front wheel drive only as I was told it is good in the snow and has been in one snow storm and one ice storm. I drove it for about 2.5 hours before purchase and liked the ride and less interior road noise then the Escape. One bad note wife said brakes felt weird. Took it to dealer and rotors needed to be replaced along with new transmitter fobs. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive. Lots of space. Great family vehicle. DIC is handy, So far fair gas mileage 19.3mpg in city and 26mpg highway. Stock sound system is excellent. Great Rrde. Good looking SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like the Chevy Equinox. We looked for a croosover for a few months. We came close to purchasing a Jeep Compass but a friend who had purchased a 2006 Equinox turned me on to the idea of purchasing one. I am glad we got the Equinox since it sits 4 inches higher than a Compass. If you are looking for an American made crossover then this is one to get. It has a smooth ride with lots of power. I recommend the LT over the LS as GM put a lot of plastic into the interior. But plastic is easy to clean and cheap to replace. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 3.4 liter 6 cylinder engine, the rims, the rear tail lights, and the height of the vehicle. Pulled up to a Jeep Cherokee on the highway and looked down on it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Equinox is a fun, fuel efficient SUV. Not only does it look great, it handles well in bad weather and it has a nice weight to it. The power window switches are in the center console, which would be the only design I would change. Overall, it is a great value and I would recommend it to anyone purchasing an SUV for the first time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite feature is the large cargo area in the back. You can fit a lot of groceries and packages. The back seat floor area is flat allowing for more storage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving a large SUV, I was very impressed with the handling of this much smaller one. I drive a lot of rough, country roads, and the handling around potholes and gravel roads was impressive, as well as the comfort on the interstate.

I test drove several other small suv's, and this one outranked them all by a long shot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first time I have driven a vehicle so agile and fun to drive. It looks great in black and catches attention wherever I go. Visability is good too, since stand is a bit higher than others. Very adjustable seats make it extremely comfortable on trips. The youthful look first caught my attention, but driving it sold me. The value for what you get is worth it. I would recommend it to baby boomers who do not want to drive around in some old man's Buick or Caddy. My vehicle has the LT package with Pioneer sound system. This adds enough high end quality that is only available on expensive SUV,s. Handling is very predictable and my wife raves about how it is her very favorite.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the style features and performance. However Chevy could have done a few things better. No individual reading lights, all lights must be on to read in the back. No mirror lights or lighted sunvisor mirrors. Power seat switch poorly located between seat and door. Only have 2000 miles on it but find fuel economy somewhat low, possibly not broken in yet. When in the front passenger seat the roof pillar doesn't allow me to lean to the right or rest my arm on the door. </TEXT>

<FAVORITE>AWD is really nice to have since you can pull out quickly under just about any conditions without worrying about flipping switches. Build quality is excellent, especially at this price point! Different builds let you price this reasonably (like we did) or "pimp it out". Handles like a sedan!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fuel economy not as good at 17 - 21, as I had hoped, but better than a Hemi or Silverado, or larger SUV. With gas at $2,50 a gallon, $45 fills her up. Larger gas tank. The designers made some bad choices in the interior, as ashtray is optional in a choice with cup holder, which is attached to the middle fold down arm glove compartment which all in all is just not a great design. Every car should have standard ashtray. Cup holders on an extended arm just asks for drinks to wiggle, shake and spill. The center tray bottom gets dirty quickly and is hard to clean. And the seats and the covering comfy but better scotch, I have the gray metallic, gets dirty easy. Larger visors, better sound.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet running. Steering, handling, and acceleration are good. Cargo space versatile and holds more than larger SUV's. Finishing is nice, auto steer and response good, Look, driveability, auto key entry, fold down seats, auto lights off, auto lights off after fifteen minutes. Seats firm, nice drive, versatile.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Watch what the window sticker says when purchasing this vehicle. On the side where everything the vehicle has is listed it says: "Unit produced without XM satellite radio". The salesman and I skimmed the list of features and assumed it had satellite and low and behold it didn't. Funny it didn't list that it didn't have sunroof! Thankfully the dealership where I purchased my Equinox honored the satellite radio and had it installed and hard wired. Con for this vehile it cannot get satellite through the radio. Something about the electrical system. Besides that.. I love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Chevy Equinox is a true competitor against the RAV4 and Santa Fe. I test drove both, and the Equinox is the best one. My decision made up of all the nice features the Equinox offers at a lower price than both the Santa Fe and RAV4. Also, the styling is so much better than the other two. The Equinox has a pretty quiet engine, it can accelerate quickly and performs well. The gas mileage is good considering its size. The new and improved 2007 interior is better than the '06 one. The truck is the biggest, inside/out, compared to the Santa Fe and RAV4. Even the stock sound system is the best. Overall, the car is fun to drive and I am happy with my purchase. This truck rocks!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Compared drive with Rav4 and Ford Escape. Drives more easily than Rav4. Ford surprisingly heavy to steer. Fun to drive this heavy 5000lb machine. Initial mileage around town about 19mpg. Relatively new to me. Solid and stable, but ease of steering could possibly cause oversteering. Visibilty on right side requires use of the side mirror. Acceleration good for freeways. Does not sway like my '95 Blazer tended to do.</TEXT>
