<TEXT>I traded in my 2003 Suburban which I loved. I can't believe the changes! I thought I was already driving a nice ride, but Chevy has out done themselves. It is much roomier, rides like a dream and handles great. I was amazed with the turning radius. I was able to make a U-turn on a divided 2 lane street without clipping the curb. I love the 8/4 5.3L engine. I am averaging 22 mpg. I will admit most of my drive is commute (65 mph). The 2 third row seats nicely fold up against the second row with ease. In this configuration I carried a four tier wedding cake (separated), two large cube ice chest, three suitcases, 6 12 can cases of soda and several loose clothing bags with room left over.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design, redesigned console/dash and the quiet ride. Feels tighter with a better finish. It is a gentle giant among other large vehicles. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Transmission is junk. 4,000 miles after warranty expired the transmission failed. Searches on the internet produced many hits with the same issue. It seems Chevy knows this is an issue and has failed to do anything about it. Sad that a vehicle that costs over $50k can fail after only 40k miles... This is my second Suburban to have the same problem. Definitely buying an import next time. Americans cannot build cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't remember if it's LT or LS. It's in the shop right now for the a/c- heat issues I've had with it since I bought it used a year ago. I have 3 kids and 2Lg dogs, it was excellent for driving from Alaska to La. last summer besides the heat going out while we were in the mts and a/c not working once we got in the southern states. Ar. dealership changed a part $250, Mechanic here changed parts twice $800+, Dealership here is trying to charge me $2,000 to replace half the a/c :( The shocks make it ride like a Cadillac. Flex fuel doesn't seem to make that big a difference. It does guzzle oil. The captains chairs in the center would be ideal in all of these large SUV's and make my job easier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Z71 4WD that uses E85 consistently. I put a K&N air system, not just the filter into the engine and the performance increased remarkably. I use synthetic oil from first oil change and have not had the oil loss that others claim, but I do change my own oil. There have been several computer upgrades that this truck needs or else trans light come on for transfer case,etc.. Once this is taken care of have not had any problems. We use this for our long distance travel and I use it for heavy construction equipment repair offroad, sometimes WAY off road and it has always amazed me and others on scene with it ability to do what custom lifted vehicles can do in factory standard mode. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort in all driving situations on and offroad. I was run of the road at night by a drunk driver while doing 70mph and had to go down an embankment. I floored the gas pedal and steered where I wanted to go and this truck did miracles avoiding a rollover and returning me to the road safely.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wife traded in her 2005 Tahoe for this truck, it has been great. A couple of minor problems - knob on rear control fell off and piece of plastic in storage area broke, but besides that no problems. Have seen the dreaded "low oil" light once, brought it in. It is currently burning 1 pint of oil every 3K miles, so I hope it does not get worse - dealer said this was common...</TEXT>

<TEXT>We got this car in anticipation of our 3rd child. I love the design and drive of this car but I have a problem with the oil. The low oil light has come on frequently causing a rebuild of the valves and a baffle replacement. I also had a drain on the battery that left my mom stranded unable to get to my daughter at school in time. Now I am told the oil problem is a problem with this model and will need a complimentary top off when it comes on. UGGG. The car isn't even 3 years old yet. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is great for the kids to get in and out of. The exterior is a great design as well. The back up camera is great and I like the onstar feature. We have the LTZ with all of the bells and whistles which I really like. The auto start is great to get the car warm or cold for the kids.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a nice SUV when we purchased it it was much more expensive than they are today. The truck is used for both work and play. The truck has served us well but it has had many service issues from the trans going out to the DVD/ CD player that stopped working at 38K. Please keep in mind it had maybe played 20CD's and 10 movies in its life. GM has been poor when it comes to standing behind this SUV. After over 30 GM cars in my life this for me is the last one my wife will only drive GM so I will have one in my garage. In the end this is a very expensive car to maintain out of warranty. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a beautiful car but within the 2 years we've had this, we have had to take it in to the dealership 10+ times for various issues (key fob, 4wd going out, 7th cylinder went out, etc). Each time one thing is fixed, something else goes out and we're left with no car. We bought it brand new no less. I have read more good than bad reviews, so I think we just bought a Monday/Friday car. If it weren't for the issues that keep cropping up, I adore this car. It's gorgeous, cushy, and compared to the Ford SUV's that cost 5k more, you get tons more features. Hopefully GM can figure out how to avoid these problems with current/future Suburbans.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is such a nice truck. It's a shame that the value of the vehicle drops like a lead balloon. My MSRP was $56000. It's now worth 27K on trade. Less than half in a year and half. Should have bought a Lexus. With what I've lost on this one I could buy the Lexus. Why is it American cars lose their value so fast compared to the imports. The leather feels like pleather not a soft type material. How sad that the Big 3 need a bailout. Maybe we should stop building these vehicles and leave it up to the foreign car market. How sad! If you are thinking of these be ready to take the big hit on resale value. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was shopping for a new Cadillac, but fell in love with 2007 Suburban. It drives and rides better. My 1992 has 210,000 miles and still does not use a quart oil between changes. So far my new one is great. I average 16 miles in town and that's better than my friend's Highlander's 15. For me and my needs our Suburban is great. It's funny all my friends drive small imports, but they aways want me to drive. My taste, guess I am use to my 1992, </TEXT>

<TEXT>17K, add engine oil light came on. Noted to be 2 qts low. Thought this was odd since too new for this to occur. 22K, light came on again. Dealer stated "not uncommon to burn thru a quart or 2 in the break in period. Funny. Light has come on at least 8 times. Burned thru 12+ qts in the past 10K. Dealer has done pressure test, die test (although they never finalized procedure as they claimed they did), checked valve springs for knicks (according to TSB). No oil coming out of tailpipe and no leaks what so ever. Dealer keeps telling me to put on more miles. No resolution to date. I'm done! Have seen others with same problem on the web. Do not recommend this vehicle & MPG stinks</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior design, the exterior design (very snazzy front end), redesigned brake system (stops on a dime), and love the "car like" ride. This is my 3rd Burb and all new school stuff. On board computer system is nice too. (Too bad the motor is garbage!) </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got rid of '05 Freestar - excellent mini van - because of whoops baby. Plane Jane, 5.3L, 3 cloth bench seats, rear air, after marked twin DVD system, sindle CD.15K miles down and not one problem. I can get 18 to 20mpg - and not a pinch more - by driving with my big toe. Wife gets 16 to 18mpg w/her 80lb foot. Not so good mpg on E85, as advertised, but performance does not suffer. Has been through four seasons, and the '07 winter in WI was rough, and did everything I asked of it. Rides great, stops great, doesn't sway in corners too much, (c'mon it's a biggie.) Fit / finish is great. Easy to work on for the do-it-yourself-er oil changer, but would change location angle of drain plug. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice looking truck but way too many serious issues in two years. SW issue that causes battery to drain, when the battery drains with this particular issue then call a flat-bed. Front right axle seal leak (can't be truly fixed as this is a design issue...just keep replacing the same gasket every time it starts leaking!) 4-wheel driver failure. Front transfer case bearing failure...special order for parts required. Rear plastic bumper loses 'shape' on the bottom within one year...looks very cheap. Very frustrating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this truck over a year ago, i could not resist. I had a an Avalanche before which I used for both construction and leisure made over 70,000 miles, and let me tell you I new I could depend on Chevy. After having a baby and with the anticipation for the new Chevy model I purchased Suburban and I would not change for anything else. The possibilities with this truck are endless. It's a safe, smooth ride, love the space.</TEXT>

Chevy did it's homework on this Suburban. A+++ is all that I can say. We get 2-3mpg more then her 05 TB. She loves he remote start, heated seats, power lift gate, power 2nd row seats.

<TEXT>I tried to convince her to get a minivan but she insisted on this tank instead. I am glad she did. This vehicle is the ultimate for hauling a big family with lots of gear. It is more comfortable to drive and be a passenger in than any vehicle I could think of. To ride in one of the rear buckets is a pleasure, I only wish I could experience more often. It also gets reasonable fuel mileage on the highway for such a monster. (better than 20 mpg).</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a mistake. The fob hasn't worked correctly since we purchased it ? seats move, windshield washer operates un- expectantly, lift-gate opens when the remote start key is pushed... Worst yet, the engine ?seized? at 15K miles. GM replaced the engine under warranty but has done nothing to assured us that we haven?t got a lemon. In fact they have just about convinced us we do! Now we have a lag between when the accelerator is pushed and the vehicle moves, which we?ve been told is ?normal? or ?within tolerance?. Going Japanese for our next vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a 1500 LTZ 2 months ago. Love this vehicle, however, there are a few recommendations: auto up windows, more storage spaces, 3rd row does not fold flat, the active fuel management only goes into 4 cylinder mode when going downhill or on decel. (My Honda Odyssey will cruise at 83 mph in 3 cylinders!) With active fuel management, my economy is no better than with my 03 Suburban without it. What's up with that? Navigation does not seem to be accurate. My Honda also is better with this. I do love the looks, styling, comfort, OnStar, DVD system except not being able to listen to a CD when kids are watching a movie. Turning radius is greatly improved over older models.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this White 2007 Suburban LT 2 with rear entertainment system for my wife as we are expecting our 5th child ( in 4 years ) and her 2004 Mazda MPV was just too small to be comfortable. I, being in the auto sales busines, ( I have been selling Mercedes Benz for 2 years ), I researched every SUV out there. After driving everything, I settled down on the Suburban. My wife was very nervous about driving such a large SUV, But After a couple of weeks with the Suburban, I can not get her to let me take it out, she is in love with it and will never go back to a mini van. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Chevy SUV. We've had the Ford Expedition and an Acura MDX. Interior design looks cheap. We've had numerous issues and recalls to contend with. Key fobs not working, replaced latch on 3rd row seat; there is not enough horsepower with the 1500 and in Houston traffic merging onto the freeway is dangerous. The Nav system is designed poorly and ineffective. And, now, latch on other seat is broken. We've not even had this car for a year yet - and it has been in the dealership for repairs 5-6 times in the first few months. If I wouldn't lose so much, I'd trade this car in today for the Expedition EL. Do not buy this car - go for the Expedition EL.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you don't want the price of leather, skip the '07 Suburban! We traded in a '02 Suburban that we loved and got a lemon. The fabric seats attract lint and hold it even through a vaccuuming with a $600 vaccuum. We have to vaccuum and then use a lint roller to even get close to getting the seats clean. We purchased fabric because we were so satisfied with the Chevy fabric in our '02 Suburban and '05 Chevy pickup. The '07 is a step in the wrong direction! At 6'4", I also have a problem with the location of the 4wheel drive knob. I knock it and turn it on everytime I get in without realizing it. Our 3rd row passenger seat has also had the knob for flipping it forward broken twice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at other SUVs but in the end the Suburban is the best choise for our family of 7. The comfort of the interior is by far the best in its class. Altough you have to get a third row 3 passanger seat upgrade to get full passanger capacity. The ride is smooth and quiet. It handles great with turns and braking. I noticed the braking time is much better on this model. I would recomend this suv to anyone looking for comfort and room. It also has the largest cargo area. And is great for moving and 4'x8' material, as well as any other home improvement materials. It's the all in one truck at a good price!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rear hatch. No tail gate to load things over. also the VIC(vehicle information center) lets you know what's going on with the truck's engine, fuel situation and trip miles and time. The standard Audio center is also enjoyable without upgrade.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the '07 Burb for 7 months now. It is my 3rd Suburban. If you need to tow forget the 2500. The hitch height is 23" vs the previous 15" and is a pain to set up. It is clear that the new Burb was designed for the ladies and the 2500 should have been dropped. The factory NAV system is so limited that I use my Garmin portable and shut it off. GM was obsessed with form and style rather than function on the 07 2500. The 6.0 engine is whimpy for a serious tow vehicle. I'd sell today if I wouldn't lose my behind on the deal. I only have 6K on the odometer rather than the 12K to 14K I put on my previous Burbs in the same time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Moved to this LTZ vehicle after 3 successive 7 series BMWs. It is day and night but it is also a pretty positive surprise. This truck drives well, has plenty of power and the luxury features (NAV, DVD, power everything) do work properly. It actually looks quite good externally and other than the gas mileage and lousy sound system (Bose premium), I have no bad thing to say about it so far. Hauling capacity is astounding.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased a 2007 Burb LTZ 4X4. Love the car! We were looking at the Ford Expedition EL, but once we drove the 'Burb, we could not go back to the Ford. The interior is so much more comfortable and logical. The Ford seemed forced. The Ford does have the better rear seats, when folded down, but we decided that we would rather be happy the other 95% of the time when we are just driving as a family. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The truck is real nice, but it is a Chevy and everything you have read about Chevy turning its products around is wrong. Now it is better than the '06 model. but still does not come close to the Japenese. I have the sunroof and it rattles like crazy. I took it back to the dealership and was told nothing wrong and I would have to deal with it. So I have $45k rattle trap. The interior is very nice, plenty of room. I guess it's about preference. I looked at the Toyota Sequoia and the Chevy does have a better interior and more room. But the quality is still not there like Toyota. It's all about what you want, but don't be fooled, it's still a Chevy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What an unbelievable machine. I went with the Z71 package to get the two- tone seats and dashboard look. Very nice! Equipped with all the toys. GM has hit a home run with this redesign. The ride is much improved and the new styling puts in the class of other luxury SUV's, but with more performance and features for the money. If you're looking for plenty of room, power, features, and comfort but without the pretentiousness of the Escalade, Navigator, or LX470, this is the perfect choice. My son and his baseball teammates loved it travelling to this past weekend's tourney! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a 2007 2500 6.0 Suburban to replace my previous 8.1. The 6.0 is way underpowered and gets about 1.5 mpg less than the 8.1 during normal driving and .5 to 1.0 less when towing. The worst part is the wind noise when towing. I had it "fixed" with a new engineering upgrade to the weather-stipping and flip gate glass and it still is really bad. The GM engineers said that this is a good as it gets and that since the noise is only during towing that's the current fix. Good answer for a $50K vehicle! If you tow, beware.This truck is severely underpowered and the wind noise will drive you crazy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Since our purchase of the '07 'burb early this year we are more than satisfied. The Suburban has lots of space, a smooth ride and a really good looking dash. Fuel mileage is great even topping the advertized 15 city and 20 highway. Parking brakes were not set up correctly - they had to be fixed. Bulb changes are a horror. These issues are minor. There were no rattles so far and we love to feel safe in this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good looking, smoth ride, excellent fuel economy for that size, auto tailgate, sunroof. Rear A/C is nice as well as rear audio. Lots of space but in the 3rd row. Quietness is perfect, no rattles or squeaks. Only 4 gear auto is no problem. Child seat restraints.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, after months and months of research we did it. 2007 LTZ 4x4. Best quality in years. GM got this one right. Mileage is very good for this burb. 15/20. I have been getting 17 mixed to work and can't wait to take it on a long trip. I'm sure we will hit 20+. I know others with much smaller SUV's that don't get as good milage and we have much more room! You know who you are. Nav is great, Smooth ride, lots of room, easy to drive. We didn't get a 'burb last time and wish we had. Do your homework you will buy one too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are comfortable. Rear camera, and parking sensor makes parking easy. Never thought we would like the XM radio but will renew it. Remote start on a cold AM. We love this 'burb.

<TEXT>I purchased this truck as a secondary SUV to my wife?s LX470. Although not quite as refined as my wife?s Lexus, the Suburban is not that far behind. It drives great, has tons of room (way more than the Lexus), looks great (I love the ?07 redesign), and gets far better gas mileage than the Lexus while providing more power. Also, when comparing to the Denali/ESV, I found the Suburban to be a far better value with very comparable features ? the horsepower difference does not seem that noticeable in everyday driving, and the low gear is important to me as I will be driving at times in deep snow in VT. I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a full-size SUV. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I would have given the Suburban good marks for some of the design features but I wanted to get everyone's attention. Donot buy this vehicle if you drive in snow. We hit a minor snow drift and are now out over $900 for front bumper repairs. After extensive time on the phone with GM, they were unwilling to stand behind the vehicle. They said it was caused by environmental issues. The environment they are talking about is the reason we have a 4x4. Now when it snows, we can't leave the house until the road is plowed. I don't have any idea what we're going to do when it snows while we're away. Based on GM's unwillingness to stand behind the design, this is the last GM vehicle I'll ever buy</TEXT>

<TEXT>Here are two updates: First, I never get better than 12/15 miles per gallon city/highway. Second and more importantly, I found the first flaw on this truck. After not being able to start the truck twice because of a run- down battery, I learned from a Chevy dealer that, because of all the lights and electric accessories in the LTZ version, you need to drive 30 minutes to recharge the battery. Mind you, this is not an issue of running accessories with the engine off. This is getting in and out of the truck and perhaps opening and closing the electric rear gate before taking your five minute drive to and from the train station every weekday. After a while the battery is dead.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I still agree 100% with my raving review posted here last year (see below). Outstanding build quality, great design, potent engine, long both on "sport" and "utility", overall a terrific truck!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought the Suburban because we needed a family vehicle that can tow 5,000lb boat/trailer. We love the car except for two things. Fuel mileage has been much less than advertised. Our city driving doesn't have too much stop and go. Highways run fast. We still average only 13.7mpg. Part of the problem is we live on a hill, and as soon as you have to climb, it drinks fuel like crazy. We also have to tow the boat over a mountain pass. Friends with diesel pickups can tow a similar boat at 80mph without breaking a sweat. On the steep parts of the climb, we can't go more than 55 because the car has to downshift. Perhaps we should have gone with the 6L engine. Diesel Suburban please!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Second Suburban I've owned. Previous one was 3/4ton 4x4. The 2007 is absolutely incredible. How they make that solid of a ride so smooth I don't know. The new body design looks so much sleeker, less boxy and biggish. Couldn't talk the wife into it initially ("it's too big"). But now she wants me to drive the Maxima and her the Suburban. Now she's saying, "It's so easy to drive." Of the big SUV's this is definitely the boss!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a longtime Suburban fan and agree with all the good stuff said in other reviews. However my Suburbans have always been business multi- use. Suburban cargo handling has always been great until now. With the 3rd row removed and the 2nd row upright, there are almost no flat surfaces, just bumps and dips. Floor distance only 7ft 6in. Door will not close on occassional plywood runs. Also not happy that I had to special order 2wd. No 2wd delivered north of Kentucky. Go to any lot in MI. All 4wd with sunroofs. Adds $3000. Ordered Suburban Sept 28. Built in Mexico(argh) Nov 15. Delivered Dec 12. That's 75 days. That's ridiculous.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love our new Suburban! This is our first foray into the SUV market. Absolutely no regrets. Space, safety features, and every possible gadget is what sold us. LT3 with almost everything. Test drove an Eddie Bauer Expedition, but didn't live up to the Suburban as far as we were concerned. The miles per gallon are better than we expected, but don't think that means it has good mpg. It just makes you aware of having a "lead foot". </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ride is great, but if you demand a smooth ride, don't go over 70mph. Steering feels like you need a good tire balance. They put new tires on after 500 miles and had to force balance just to get it within specs. I feel like I got a lemon. I hate sitting at long red lights. It feels like at idle that it's missing a plug wire. Junk.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Suburban. My '01 was a quantum improvement over my '95. The '07 dropped the dual visors, and several small storage areas, no lock on console. Headliner, visors, and plastic trim finish looks cheaper to me. GPS has poor software and database. ie, 3-D view of map is only map display option and street level data is limited even in urban areas. Buy a Garmin C330. Get better performance and save big dollars. It takes forever for the screens to change on the display. On the positive side I have had no rattles or other problems since delivery. Would be great performance wise with a diesel. GM's design concept was on the right track, but too many compromises to save on build cost.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A big upgrade! The new body style has four main areas of significant improvement: Interior quality: New interior is night and day improvement. Appearance, design, fit and finish, and quality and touch of the materials are all vastly better. Quietness: While the previous vehicle was quiet, now it is absolutely silent while cruising. But when you ?step on it? hard, the V8 burble becomes audible and sounds great. Well done GM. Steering and handling: The new steering is noticeably more precise, ?tight? and controllable. No wallow or float. The new Suburban drives like it?s half its size and weight. Brakes: Firmer pedal feel, more confident and effective braking.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The additional room, features, and luxury are much appreciated. Beautiful inside and out, to look at, and to drive. Super comfortable seats. Great sound system. Compared to our previous 2004, the new one seems like a Lexus inside. Nice job GM!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Decided to move up to a large SUV to accomodate our growing family and have been very pleased. We have an LT3 trim level vehicle with most of the options (sunroof, Nav radio, rear DVD, power liftgate, rear camera, heated seats) white with the tan interior. Rides and handles great on road, not much off road use yet. Front and 2nd row bench seats are reasonably comfortable. 3rd row is fair for adults, good for kids. Nav radio/ rear DVD system works well. Vehicle has some nice touches. For example, dome lamp override keeps the lights off to offload sleeping kids at night, the remote vehicle start during cold weather turns on the seat heaters. Exterior style nicer than it's Yukon XL cousin</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear back-up camera (highly recommended) and rear parking assist works well. Nav radio & rear DVD systen is nice. Power liftgate is convienent. Remote start. Heated washer fluid. Power tumble 2nd row. Heated seats. Rainsense wipers automatically change speed based on need.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My LTZ is the best riding car I have ever owned. It rides better than my 2000 Pathfinder and 2004 Murano. It handles like a car, or Murano, and really moves when you need it.

It made it so much more fun than two cars!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the LTZ model. The build quality of this SUV is amazing, dead quite inside, no rattles or squeaks. Interior materials are outstanding, too. Steering is precise and direct and the brakes bite. The overall driving experience is that of an expensive German sedan. The engine sounds great when you floor the pedal and power is impressive at higher RPMs. Lower in the power band, though, torque is not overwhelming. A six speed transmission (apparently in the works) will certainly help. I don't know where they get those fantasy fuel economy numbers from! So far, suburban driving has yielded 11 and a trip to Maine with a loaded car 17.5 miles/gallon. Overall not bad for such a big SUV, though!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, space, build quality, great interior, excellent fit and finish. Comfortable and effortless long distance cruiser. First rate sound and navigation system. This is a SUV that runs with the best of them in every respect and GM should be proud of it! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the 4th Suburban that I've leased. Each one keeps getting better in terms of design, comfort, styling and performance. If it wasn't for teh Chevrolet emblem, you would think you were driving the Cadillac. I like the vehicle for its handling and performance. For a large vehicle, I find that it accelerates well for its size, and handles much like a sports car. The cargo space allows me to carry equipment for the various activities that I engage in, as well as having enough room and comfort for my passengers. Keep up the good work GM!!!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, comfort, performance and reliability. Electronic dual climate control along with rear seat passenger seaparate climate control.

<TEXT>We really like our '07 Suburban. We had a 2004 but decided to purchase the '07 for two reasons. As the mother, I wanted to get it because of the side curtain airbags and the backing up sensors and camera. My husband wanted to buy it because it is "sweet." We haven't had it long, but did lots of research and don't think we will regret it. We have black exterior, black leather so I'm not sure if we have any mismatched colors like the other reviews. I really wish GM would put moms on their beta team for future models. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very few 2500 4WD 3/4 ton on west coast. Vehicle drives extremely well on wet pavement. Comfort is excellent, plenty of room in the back for food, kids etc. Compared with Tahoe, for the same price but with 3 extra feet of cargo space. XM satellite radio does not work on major roads where I live in Washington. Wish it came without wood grain finish, but only in LS models. Center console is a little confusing</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lots of little cabin noises. You feel every little bump in the road like a sports car. Front passengers sit like a compact thanks to the ever trendy (monster) center console, while the rear is like a school bus. 2nd bench seat is in an unconfortable,upright,fixed position (won't recline). 3rd seat is very difficult to acess. Every time you adjust the AC or turn the car off and on, the AC reycycle turns off. My '06 Silverado does the same thing. We live in Atlanta and use recycle because it cools much better and won't pull in cigarette and exhaust smoke in stop and go traffic. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We wanted this car forever. Heard they were changing the body style so we waited another year!! Glad we did. The truck handles great. The traction control really works. I was making a turn onto a wet just paved street and the truck started to spin. The traction control kicked in and set the truck straight! That is the best feature they could have added to a truck this size. The only complaint is I only get 12.5 miles to the gallon. How long does it take for the fuel management system to kick in? I only have 800 miles on it, maybe someone can let me know. Also, we have black leather and light tan looking headliner which looks weird. Other than that we love it, drives so smooth, and quiet!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The design and layout is excellent. Interior is very comfortable and exterior is sharp. It handles and accelerates very well for such a large vehicle and I actually believe we will get the EPA rated 15mpg city once the engine breaks-in thanks to the Fuel Management System. The Suburban is well worth the price paid. My only complaint is that when the DVD ordered, you get a gray roof even though we have tan interior. The DVD the headliner, the switch panels - everything above is gray and the rest of the interior is tan. The mismatch is just a bit odd.</TEXT>
