<TEXT>I really like the style and comfort. It is especially nice when compared to the competition and how much more their vehicles are. This tows more than almost any other SUV and the gas mileage isn't great but it's good for an SUV. It does better than my wife's Jeep Commander with the 4.7l V-8. And it does almost as well with mpg on the highway as my wife's old 2005 mini van. This is a great vehicle for the price and has been extremely reliable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I definately would give give this SUV a FIVE-STAR. It is such a great vehicle to drive. It's reliable, classy, and fun. All the kids and their friends fit in just fine. When it's just the adults, it's certainly a nice ride. I compare it to the other SUV's out their, and this one tops them all, especially the for the price you pay. Chrysler did good, just wish you were continuing to make them. My lease is coming up and I now want a HEMI. Oh, what's a girl to do!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Oh I do love this car! Overall best car I have owned, my 11th new car. I'm retired now and don't drive a lot anymore so mpg not an issuse for me, but I had back surgery and my Durango was very uncomfotable after that. The wife said "do not bring home a white car" so this vanilla color bailed me out! I average 14 mpg around town, my first Hemi got 8 and, I like having the accelleration getting onto the expressway and passing. My adult kids call it dad's pimp mobile. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power liftgate, especially down, no slaming. Heated seats front & second row, temp controls front & rear. Running boards & handles for getting in & out. Power. DVD was nice on trip, first trip in years without backseat helpers!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love our Aspen, it handles well and the bells and whistles are awesome. We haven't had any malfunctions to speak of, although my husband has noticed something strange at the pumps, he often fills up when the needle is on E, and as he fills the tank he expects the gallons on the pump to match what he knows the tank should hold, the numbers come close to matching. It's as if there's a few unrecorded gallons left in his tank (but it's a significant amt). The dealer has checked it out too, and no one can explain it. It's weird. Our one complaint, the rear seats are FIXED. They cannot be slid forward or backward by the occupant to accommodate a tall driver or someone in the 3rd row!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rear sensors are a lifesaver and so is the rear DVD system with the wireless headphones (we have 2 kids). In particular, I love the positioning of the rear AC vents which are mounted on the ceiling, not at your ankles!!! The automatic gate lift is a huge plus too. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this as a left-over new 2007 after looking at a Pacifica, and glad that this is what I chose. Highway miles with the 5.7 Hemi are between 21 and 23 MPG. Keeping the tach under 2000 rpm helps a lot. Towing is no problem recently towed a 6 x 12 U-Haul trailer loaded and still got 14 mpg. Towing a boat is like it isn't there. Comfort is great, the ride and handling are excellent. Fit and finish are excellent. Even with gas going through the roof, I don't see me trading down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a used 07, All options, Hemi, Nav, Remote Start, everything. I bought it in Atlanta, GA I live in Roanoke, VA. Trip home was good. 455 miles and got 21.2 mpg on the Hemi MDS engine. No complaints on gas. A vehicle this size! That?s good. It could have been better I suppose but I was on and off the gas, since I had a new toy! It has a smooth ride, very quiet. The Hemi climbs the mountains effortlessly. I was going 80 mph up the mountains at only 2000 rpm. It gets a lot of looks. The 20? chromes really set it off. The third row seat access is by far the easiest out there. The lever on the second row seat is so simple. Get the Hemi with MDS. No use for the Flex fuel, No 85oc here.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hemi power, Fuel saving MDS, Nav, both front windows are automatic down with a touch of a button!, Remote Start, Steering wheel radio controls, third row ease of access, memory seats and settings, It's a sharp looking vehicle, 20" chrome rims and the rest of the chrome. LED's make a soft light.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great SUV. My first was a Ford Explorer. I loved it. However when switching between the two for the past 9 months showed me what a great ride the Aspen is. Very smooth. Didn't buy it for the mpg... But, it isn't very good. IF you drive really slow, even on highway, 20 mpg is best. If you have hills, wind, to pass, etc the mpg drops to 16 quick...</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an excellent SUV for the Price. The limited has all the features other similar SUVs have at a lower cost. Unfortunately the vehicle has been in the service department 4 times because the engine malfunction light comes on and causes the vehicle to have drivability issues. I have been to 2 different dealerships and nobody can find the cause of the issue which has caused a serious safety issue. Be cautious about buying this new model</TEXT>

<TEXT>It rides like a dream, handles very well, and has all the power, with a K&N air charger- power all the more! Bottom line, it's comfy, stylish, responsive, quick and only costs around 32K, as we all know, you can't get an Acura for that, as if I'd want one after this gem! If you pass this up, go back to Uranus or whatever other planet that is in the deep cold of overcharging for the same vehicle that is everywhere, just slightly "Emblemed". I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This SUV is fanatastic! I had an Expedition for a little while a couple of years ago but quickly traded it in because it felt and drove like a truck. The Aspen is a dream.

<TEXT>Certainly fun to drive with an excellent ride. Feels like a heavier vehicle with tremendous power (Hemi). 18 inch wheels offer nice handling and smooth ride. Lots of compliments on looks. Installed satellite (Sirius) at dealer. $700 compared to $185 from factory; so get it from factory if can. At 6' 3", the door entry is small and seat is not wide for large behind. UConnect is awesome. Rear storage is small with 3rd row up. The lack of dual zone (driver/passenger) climate control is strange for vehicle that lists for $42,500; same comment for satellite. Interior is attractive, but leather is stiff. The small glove box on dash is annoying; center console is deep but awkward to access. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>UConnect is simple to use and works right out of the chute. Excellent power. Great looks. Nice trim. Navigation system works good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow, I am still having fun driving this beast after one year. I own a 5.7 hemi limited all equipped except for the NAV. I believed that all reviews are pretty accurate. However, I will comment on Canadian winter driving with lot of snows, freezing rains, icy conditions the driving is OK with the 20' tires but would strongly recommend winter tires but hard to find. This is my 1st year with winter tires and nothing can stop me. The 4 wheel drives is extremely precise and can not feel anything when all wheels are slipping. My wife, kids and I feel extremely safe in the vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>To set the record straight, I own a 5.7 HEMI Limited. I've driven most all the SUV's in its class and this one feels the lightest due to its power. The fit-and-finish comments I am reading just aren't true; the Chrysler interioir is on par with what you will find on the market. The fold-up second row seats are the easiest to use for my small wife.....use one hand and 2 clicks. My Jeep Commander, in contrast, is much harder. Styling is hit or miss but everyone looks at it and asks us about it because they have never seen one before and they all comment on how pretty it is. Bottomline is that it hauls, hauls all 4 of my daughters, wife loves the bells/whistles.....great buy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the HEMI most and I think the wife loves the ease of use of the second row pop-up seats and the hands free back door opener. My 7 year old, 45 pound daughter can pop the seat up and climb in the rear on her own.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I just bought the Aspen. This thing rocks. We got the HEMI, DVD, NAV, leather heated seats and so on. We bought this as a lease return and noticed the fuel is a little poor, but it is a big suv with lots of power. Everyone who has seen it has loved the interior and the exterior as well. Mention it has a HEMI and they say wow. The gas mileage is about 16 mpg in rush hour traffic, not to bad.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather heated seats, Nav, DVD (for the kids) 3rd row seats, plenty of power and lots of towing capability 8900lbs. Saturn only pulls 4500lbs. my jeep liberty tows more than that. pretty sad for saturn to be in the big SUV catagory towing that little.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This SUV is the bomb. I get compliment after compliment on it. It's loaded and I feel rich driving it. It came with a lifetime powertrain warranty, however, I purchased the extended bumper to bumper warranty which is lifetime as well. Yes, I said lifetime bumber to bumper. What can I say, I have had past problems with American made vehicles. Although, I doubt it will give me as many problems as my Chevy Trailblazer and Buick Rendezvous. That Hemi just hums. You will be noticed and you can't beat the price-period. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Chrysler has an invisible winner in the Aspen. We selected the Aspen after testing the following SUVs: Tahoe, Escalade, Yukon, Navigator, Commander, and Sequoia. None of them came equipped with as many standard features as the Aspen for less money. The ride, fit & finish, performance and looks are standouts in the SUV crowd. The 5.7 Hemi has terrific performance and decent mileage if you keep your foot out of the throttle. It?s a shame Chrysler toss more advertising dollars at this vehicle to increase customer awareness. I?m constantly getting complements and questions at the gas station with this rig. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is not a pretend SUV, I have owned SUV's for 15 years and watched them become watered-down, shadows of themselves. In '02 got a new Suburban loved it, but GM has done nothing significant with style or powerplant. Chrysler has shown they can combine rugged performance and styling to come up with a vehicle that performs and is appealing to the eye. GM and Ford have allowed their large SUV's to become oafish by comparison. Their design teams just do not get it in my opinion. Europe and Japan aren't making anything comparable for under $70k.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a Yukon Denali in March 07. Sold it 90 days later because I hated the 3rd row seats that had to be removed. To replace it, I test drove a Jeep Commander, Mercedes GL 450, Nissan Armada & Pathfinder, Infiniti QX56, Toyota 4Runner, Ford Explorer & Expedition, Acura MDX, etc.-all with fold flat 3rd rows. With 3 kids, I need separation on trips. The most accommodating vehicle in terms of comfort and functionality was the Expedition. 3rd row is comfortable even for adults. Steering is accurate and has good feel. Seats are fantastic. But V8 is weak! Jeep Commander (Hemi) was next and had more features than Aspen (i.e. rain sensing wipers), but interior was too tight. Aspen had same Hemi.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior LED ambient and instrument lighting. Thick-rimmed wood steering wheel. Overboosted steering effort. Adjustable pedals. 2nd row center console.

Picks up like a rocket and is better on highway gas than my 4 cyl car was! Its not as good city but not bad either. Plenty of room and better features than some of the supposedly "top of the line" trucks. Chrysler has truly outdone themselves on this one! People are sleeping on this truck but that's okay.

<TEXT>One word: phenomenal. The second I saw a printed ad of this vehicle, I told my wife "that's it." We'd been shopping for 12-18 months. I rented one on a business trip and immediately began visiting dealerships upon returning. Bought one used, saved thousands, couldn't be happier. Were leaning toward a 2007 Yukon/Tahoe, but their 3rd seat has to be lifted out, doesn't mostly fold into floor like the Aspen. Ridiculous. I'm an older Gen X'er and I still get told "sweet ride" by the younger crowd. My kids are thrilled, wife hauls the groceries seemlessly, and I just punch the Hemi when hauling our boat. Superb vehicle. This is the sleeper SUV no one's talking about.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this SUV after falling in love with one that my sister has. It is worth a test-drive so that you can erase the stereotypes about Chrysler/Dodge. Both the exterior and interior are superb, and it seems as if they have practical engineers on the job who designed the car for everyday cost-consciuos people who want an SUV to envy! The features in the Aspen make it worth way more than its cost. The features rival those of pricier car-makers but with a no-frills price. As a VP in marketing, I believe the Aspen was created to boost Chrysler's SUV appeal, so they put all these top features as a repositioning campaign and more folks need to discover the secret.</TEXT>

Well, once again Chrysler has done it! I have the 28J package in the Pearl Black and have already received several positive comments about the look. It drives flawlessly and there is plenty of room to fit my 6'5" frame along with the rest of the family. The interior design is quality, leaps and bounds above the competition in addition to the 20 inch wheels along with Hemi put the Escalade, Navigator, and Denali series to shame.

<TEXT>Wow! Nice to see an American Made SUV of such high quality. Quality is evident everywhere - from the wood steering wheel, to the super comfortable leather. WE LOVE IT! The stability control feature works like a wonder driving in a Snow storm. The HEMI engine is much more powerful than the Sequoia we drive, and the vehicle feels more substantial. We loved the Five Star treatment at the dealership. So friendly and helpful! This is our First Chrysler - but I'm thinking it won't be the last! Good Job Chrysler!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Couldn't ask for a more comfortable car to drive. Love everything about it. Wonderful for kids. Even though it looks a little like a Durango....I get asked all the time how I like it and told that it sure is a beautiful vehicle. As a side point..a Lexus backed into the bumper, my damage was 800.00 his was 4,000.00. I'd say it's pretty sturdy. To bad the Lexus didn't have rear sensors like my Aspen does.

<TEXT>Rented for the Thanksgiving week, drove about 1200 miles round trip. Before driving: A very executive, commanding looking SUV. Smart and simply elegant interior design, most everything intuitive. Driver position very nice and adjustable. Lots of nice controls on the wheel. Driving: Be easy on the gas because despite its size, this SUV will put you in the back of your seat and keep you there through the smooth shifts. Tires and shocks smooth away most jars yet you maintain a nice feel for the road. Road is nicely illuminated with the foglight combo. Aspen makes the long haul trip easy, in town driving very manageable but keep your gas card at the ready and plenty of braking room.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power was surprisingly good. Even maneuvering in traffic was relatively easy. Cruise control was smooth even in the hills. Built in DC to AC converter is a nice touch. Very good noise and bump suppression. Really liked the simple and elegant design of the vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased last month and paid 4,000 off sticker. Great ride and cornering. I tow a snowmobile trailer and it tugs it like you don't know what's behind you. I pack in 8 adults and threw the kids in it yesterday at school. What a great all-round suv built by Daimler Chrysler!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wonderful ride quality at an exceptionally good price. Good equipment level and nice finishing touches. The ride is positive, comfortable and at all times you feel under control, despite the large size. Build appears solid and have not noted any drifting at sharper turns. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just sold Chrysler 300C HEMI and am so happy with the Aspen HEMI. Exact combination of 300C, Pacifica and Crossfire that I was craving. Aspen drives so smoothly, great acceleration and thrust -- HEMI is the perfect engine for this SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is luxury, luxury, luxury.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Has the look of a Pacifica with the room of a suv. Design similarities like the ribbed hood have crossed over from the crossfire. Handles well not sluggish and does not wallow like some big suv's. Will tow my boat as well as haul my kids their friends and the dogs. Am very happy with it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Analogue clock on dash. Wood accents as well as wood steering wheel. Very classy.</FAVORITE>
