<TEXT>Very upset with this purchase. Have only had a few months and my engine light is on. Today as I drove it, it started bucking, wouldn't go over 30 mph. I've read many reviews today about this being a common problem. (another site). The dealer can't get me in today, so I'm SOL. I am paying quite a bit for this car, and having it for such a short amount of time and this is wrong. Not happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the design of the car. The old style look outside as well as the dash. Comfy to ride in, too. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Presently I have 83,000 miles on my PT Cruiser. I've only had to replace brakes once, tires once and of course numerous oil changes!!! I do a lot of highway driving and get decent mileage, about 25/mpg. Its a joy to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for a franchise that I later sold but kept the car. At 20K miles it needed new brake pads & rotors and again at 40K miles!! The A/C compressor died at 30K. Now, the check engine light is coming on and it is driving very rough. There is only 40K miles on this car, folks! I would never have bought a Chrysler if it was not the car of choice for the franchise I owned at the time and will NEVER buy one again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my '07Cruiser touring edition in '07 and like many features of this car including: the old style look of a 1940's car, the dash board features (outside temp., compass, avg. mi. per gal., mi. till empty..etc.), good cd player, good ac and heat, unique "handle bar" on passenger side, well thought out middle console with 3 cup holders and middle storage with sliding arm rest, smooth ride, good brakes and easy gas pedal, back seats fold down and can come out for plenty of cargo room, stylish interior of textured material. Feels more upscale than you actually pay for it. I recommend this car to those who appreciate old style of cars & who want something that looks nice w/o paying alot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>i love my pt cruiser, i never get tired of it, or get tired of driving it...i love the cool vanilla color, but i wish that it was red cause thats my fav color, i love the ride its very comfortable and smooth, handling is amazing, i can zip around curves like a sports car...it has really good power for a non-turbo, well at least mine does...if you want a lil extra power add a cold air intake, it makes it a lil zippier plus it gives it a nice sounding growl...i love almost everything about the car except for the gas mileage it gets decent but i expected better...i just hate that chrysler is fixin to stop making them...i highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am retired. Great car/suv for short trips. Entry comfort is perfect/style has no equal. No mechanical problems. Cheap to buy and maintain and insure. Production has ended at the end of 2009. Parts will be available for years. I think Chrysler made a mistake in getting rid of this one. HHR sales have never equaled PT's. This car/suv will be a retro classic and we all want to go back to the past.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I always loved the look of the PT so I broke down and bought one in 2007. Since my purchase have had it in the shop 4 times for check engine light and now I am having to replace the brakes and rotors and barely have 20K miles. Service personnel said they have had this trouble with the PT Cruisers. Why did'nt they tell me that when I bought it? No wonder Chrysler is needing a bailout when they make such bad cars. I have never bought a new car that needed any major mechanical work before 30K and most didn't need work until 60K miles. I am very disappointed in this car and will never buy a Chrysler again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After months of research and reading reviews on this site and others, I bought my PT Cruiser in Augusy 2008. I absolutely love it! It's cool looking and fun to drive. I down sized from an Explorer so the extra miles per gallon is also a plus. It could do with a little more power on the highway though. I haven't had any problems with it in the 4 months I've owned it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior design is very unique. I still have enough cargo room for myself and my 2 kids. It's small on the outside, but still roomy for the 3 of us on the inside.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought a new 2007 Touring Edition in June 2008. It's my second Cruiser but with more bells & whistles! The mileage could be better, but as I'm retired, I now put on only about 1/2 the miles I did when working, and it's mostly short trips. I have back difficulties and with the Cruiser I managed to take a trip to Door Co. WI, without discomfort. Heating and cooling systems are excellent. Love the compass, outdoor temp gauge, and # of miles 'til empty. And everyone thinks it's a"cool" car for a granny to be driving! I'm totally pleased with my PT Cruiser!</TEXT>

<TEXT>recently purchased my 2007 cruiser and couldn't be happier. i was recently in a pretty bad accident in another car and it became totaled so when i was looking to buy another car i wanted something i knew would feel safe. i test drove other cars the cobalt and the mazda 6 but they didn't feel right i got in the cruiser and feel in love i couldn't be happier with how it drives and how much fun everyone has getting in it and driving around. I'm only 20 but i do a lot of traveling with friends and need the extra space that i didn't have in my other car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had this PTC for about 2 mos. It was a previously owned rental vehicle and was in very good condition (in and out). It rides smoothly, has a nice road feel and get around 25 mpg (overall). It's not a very economical city driver (below 20 mpg) but most folks (like me) use primarily highway. I get people commenting about it all the time. They/I like the styling (the convertible looks much nicer than the sedan), the color (opal) and the fact that is can seat passengers in the back-seat with reasonable comfort. The trunk is a bit small but slightly above average, for a convertible. The 16" alloy wheels are sharp (but I will soon replace the Goodyear tires - which are awful). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The single CD stereo sounds nice and the radio gets decent reception. The top goes down/up easily. The interior is laid out well (cup-holders could be placed better). I also like the info center (temp, compass, etc.). It's a nice touch for this kind of vehicle). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Needed to get a FWD car for towing behind my RV and thought to offset GAS with a smaller car. Being a Big Guy was shocked at the room or lack of it in some of these small cars, had to be designed by the same guy who come up with Airplane seats! Got in the PT Cruiser. Liked it at once. Great comfort, smooth ride, okay maybe not the best gas mileage, but all things considered, now wished I got one with more Bells & Whistles. I think the next one will be. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought our cruiser and have gotten decent mileage. We are getting 23 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the hwy. We traded in a trailblazer that I loved, in return for better gas mileage. For the price, we really got a good deal. Just as much seat room, little less in storage, but none the less way better on gas. We were skeptical of the "hearse looking car" at first, but loved this inside so much we bought it. Talked to another gentleman with a cruiser that had 78,000 mi on it and never had one problem. Looking forward to many more miles and less gas. Great buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought 2 PTs in March '08-a Limited Edition for Mom and a Pacific Coast Highway Edition for our teenager. We both love our new cars! Best feature is the utility of the vehicle--love all the options in the back-absolutely perfect for beach trips, groceries and softball equipment. We have actually gained on the Mpg as we "broke-in" the cars (both were brand new at purchase). We love the retro styling, pick-up is just fine; SO FUN TO DRIVE! So much better than those sedans!! Enjoy your ride and long live the PT!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I guess I shouldn't admit it, but I love the lumbar driver's seat. Also, the utility of the vehicle and the retro styling. The heating/cooling system is just great and so is the sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have read many previous reviews on the 07 Cruiser, some have been calling this vehicle a "Compact Car" and them complaining about the mileage. I have to say that I have the basic model with no cruise control and I get 21 MPG city and that a site better than the 12 MPG I was getting in my 4X4 pickup. It handles great, corner tight. I love my PT Cruiser! My suggestion is, if you think this is a compact car, think again before you buy. PT's are small type SUV's and wagons, the little convertible may be classified as a car but the others are not.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't say enough good things about the PT Cruiser. I drive an '04, and we were so happy with it we purchased my wife an '07. The car is excellent, a great tradeoff of comfort, utility and economy. The fold down seats and interior room allow us to carry just about anything we need. I purchased an 8' countertop at Home depot, folded down the seats pushed the countertop in and closed the hatch. Mileage not the greatest, but still good. My wife and I both get about 24 city and 30 - 31 highway. My 04 has 98,500 miles and has been trouble free. Daughter's boyfriend just purchased an 08 PT based on what he saw with ours.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior size - at 6'2" I have PLENTY of head and leg room. Plenty of room for passengers as well. Great ride; quiet and smooth. I love the styling. An all around fun car to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was hooked on the style of the PT even before it came out so I guess I was pre-sold. But it took me 6 years to get one since I needed the size my old Mopar van had. Now I have my PT and I love it! Sure, it's a base sedan with just an automatic and A/C but it has all the toys I need and corners sharp and my teen-age grandson thinks its "cool". I'm a "husky" six-footer who finds the headroom generous and the legroom more than adequate and can reach all the window/stereo/HVAC controls without stretching. Gripes? Well, it could get better mileage but it weighs 3100 lbs (a Z-06 Vette is only 700lbs more!). It reminds me of my old PV544 Volvo: same handy size, same old-time looks, same swagger!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a super deal. Convertible and the wind blowing back your hair. I love the single button top off/down as well as all windows down, too! Gas mileage a bit low but this car is solid. People always comment the cruiser convertible is "sweet",esp. the cream w/black top. One tiny suggestion: hazard button too close to radio controls (you get the idea).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Attitude, humor and styling are what this vehicle is all about. PT Cruiser owners are a cult unto their own. The car is neither too big nor little. The seats are neither too hard nor soft. The engine is neither too powerful or a pussy cat. Owning a PT Cruiser is an adventure into selfish realism and being an owner of such an ?AG? colored vehicle is youthful, courageous and magnificent. And that is all I have to say.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you're looking for a well appointed convertible but want to keep your purchase in the low teens, look no further than the Pt Cruiser Touring with the 2.4L turbo 4 cylinder. Build quality, ride, and handling are very good. The 4cyl is a little rough at idle but has good acceleration due to the turbo. The convertible has a heavy car feel to it. At highway speeds, the car is suprisingly quiet with the top down. You can carry on a conversation without shouting and/or listen to the radio. The PT has a real backseat for two, and the trunk is adequate. While retro styled cars are past their prime(the reason why the price is so low), the Pt is still very attractive and very fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite features are the exterior looks with the top up, firm front seats, retro style gauges and dash.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Sick to my stomach</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This car has by far the worst gas mileage in the CITY that I have ever experience in my life! I used to have an 84 Chevy Caprice Wagon Estate and it got better gas mileage and was a more comfortable ride. For shorter people like me (I am 5 foot 3) the car is extra roomy, but for someone a little bit taller I would be a little bit concerned in the front seats. I simply hate this vehicle and I can't wait for them to repo it. It's not even worth paying for any more... I am just going to take the hit to my credit and move on amicably. They will just write it off as a loss and sell my debt to a collections agency anyways. I have never in my life been disgusted with a vehicle until now. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I bought the vehicle brand new and the radio and speakers are nice but they aren't as great as my 05 Dodge Neon's were. I like having the window buttons in the middle console instead of on the door, but it can get confusing to others riding with you. I like the three cup holders in the front.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got my 2007 PT Crusier from a private car broker after I had got into a car accident in my 2000 Toyota Camry in Feb. Now I'm a tall girl and my head hits the ceiling if I don't have the seats laid back. I am the claustrophobic type & since the ceiling also slants more down in the front that causes a problem for me too. The drive is a little more rough when I compare it to my old Camry. The PT does not have little cubbies like my Camry did and you sit very high up in the car to the point that you think you're driving a truck. The back seats have great head room though but the leg room is quite small. It's December now and I'm trading in my PT. Hopefully tomorrow cause I'm sick of driving it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow! Horrible gas mileage! I seriously thought there was something wrong with it when I got it, but apparently it's in working order. How can I get 14 MPG in town in 4 cyl and only 22-24 highway. Please. I would expect this mileage from a mid to large size SUV not a car. This car needless to say is gone, or on its way out. It's not that the features or styling that I don't like, which I do, but when you're driving 150-300 miles per day, yea filling that puppy up everyday is just putting to many read numbers in quick book for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2007 cool vanilla Cruiser base with automatic and cruise control in 09-2007. Liked the vehicle so much I purchased another cruiser touring edition for my wife. Both vehicles drive and ride extremely well. Being senior citizens we enjoy the ease of entering and exiting this vehicle. Gas mileage is 22-23 cith and 26-28 highway. I drove Fords for forty two years but the PT Cruiser is far better than any Ford I ever owned. Fun to drive, sits up high, road visability is great and visibility from inside out is good with no blind spots like their is with the HHR. The PT for the money and value, and reliability with a lifetime warranty can't be beat in my mind. Very happy with </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2007 PT Cruiser vehicle because consumer repots show it to be economy friendly. The driving performance is amazing. It really holds the road well. I live in the country so most of the roads are 55mph and higher. The vehicle takes a curve with total smoothness and comfort. I have found nothing that I do not like about the vehicle. I purchased it for price, consumer rateings and gas usage. It is extrmely good on gas. My father has a 2007 expedition and the PT Cruiser feels just as smooth of a ride as his 35,000$ vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new Cruiser, its fun to drive, easy on gas, comfortable to drive in. The turning circle is wider than I expected. The drive is smooth. I have driven in the mountains with this and it acts like a typical 4 cylinder, but has adequate power to make it up the mountains. The a/c is cold - important in Arizona! The fold down/take out seats are a real plus for carrying things in the back. My daughter does complain that the seating in the rear is not as comfortable as the front. My husband has bad knees and finds the higher seating very comfortable both to drive as well as getting in and out of the car. We are very happy with the car and look forward to many years with the new PT.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just love my new PT Cruiser! It's bright red and my husband and I bought some aftermarket chrome to jazz it up more. We put the chrome beltline on it and chrome around the lights and added a wood-look dash/radio control kit. It is the 2CK option with the leather seats and chrome body side mouldings and chrome wheels. It is beautiful and fun. I love the way it handles and it has more pickup on the highway than my old 4-cylinder "Mommy Van" I get 19 city and 22 hwy mileage. Not great, but about what I got with my other 4 cylinder van. I can fold down and tumble up the seats to fit two dog crates in it and this weekend I fit an ocean kayak in it! It does everything I ask of it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Averaging 23 MPG so far - 19-20 City and 28 highway with the standard engine and 4-speed automatic. Note: I don't exceed the speed limits and only use the air conditioning on the hottest days. Absolutely no problems so far - everything works as it is supposed to. Engine performance is fine for me - better than the 2002 Ford Focus with stnadard engine that I was driving, with gas mileage about 2 MPG less than the Focus.</TEXT>

My PT stalled out on me 2 times! Embarassing for a new car. Check Eng light came on and off regularly, finally it was diagnosed as oxygen sensor. Clear lens on dash developed 2 cracks, A/C made noise when recurculate was turned on and off. All fixed politely by my accomodating dealer, however it is a hassle. I dread long term reliability and would sell right now if not for huge loss. Front seats have stains from water spills? Should have gone for the HHR for the extra 3-4K $. I do not recomend this car </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth shifting transmission. Nice interior fit and finish, excellent eletronics and radio. Exterior and interior design. Electric blue paint is very nice. Wagon untility, great for runs to home center and supermarket. Head and leg room are ample for large adults. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Cruiser in the Keys</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Rented a PT Cruiser for a week long trip through the Florida Keys. It was MUCH more "fun" than I would have expected - I'm 6'3 and the driving position was more comfortable than most vehicles. The Touring Turbo has pretty good pick-up and handling was really good for such a tall vehicle. VERY impressed with the fit and finish.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>PT Yellow</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I love my pale yellow PT. It's really a head turner. The car is so comfortable to drive. Its peppy. The ride is absolutely firm and first rate. Material quality is very good. This car is really quiet on the freeway. And, I got a lot of really great equipment with the PT. Be sure to get a Touring level with the Signature Package. The chrome wheels look great with the car. The Boston Acoustics Sound System is a must as is XM Radio. I am really doing to enjoy this car a lot. I was not expecting this much WOW factor. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior. Chrome Wheels. Seats. Boston Acoustics Sound System.Trip Computer. Seating in both front and rear. Quality of materials. Ride with Touring Suspension. The interior is really well done. </FAVORITE>
