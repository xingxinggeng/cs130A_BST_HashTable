<TEXT>This is our second Sienna; our 1998 was fine. We've had the 2007 model for two years now, and it's had a lot of trouble with the run-flat tires. A couple of flats, and the air-pressure warning light comes on way too often. Today I took another flat to the dealer; the service department said "you're not supposed to just replace one of these at a time -- we should do all four. Otherwise, if the differential fails or the transmission fails, Toyota won't cover it under warranty." So -- throw away 3 good tires (only half worn) and spend $1000 on new run-flats, or Toyota won't honor the warranty? Ridiculous. Also, this van gets at least 20% worse mileage than our old one. Disappointing!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good DVD player. Like the power outlet in the back -- my kids can plug in their Playstation for long trips. Decent seats. Good flexibility in folding/storing seats. AWD is surefooted on snow.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was told to choose: Sienna or Odyssey. My mistake. At this rate I probably wouldn't pick either! We're very disappointed with this car. Under the hood, yes it's ok. It's the small stuff that's frustrating. It seems like there is always another minor issue. Of course some really are just minor (ie: the window trim comes off) but still annoying. We paid too much for these issues! The stuff that really bothers me is things like the very loud rattling on the right side sliding door. (taken in...no one can find anything wrong) I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone. There must be something decent out there other than the Sienna or Odyssey. Off to the auto show :-(</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A lot of leg room in all three rows. I like the 7 seat arrangement with captain seats. This makes things a lot easier when buckling kids into car seats in the third row. Can't imagine having a car without this option!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this van! I do a lot of driving - almost 700 miles a week simply routine, not including other out of town trips. This mini van is one the the best and reliable vehicles I have had (the other being a Toyota as well, a Tercel back in the 90s). It's comfortable, rides smooth and looks great too. The only annoyance has been the tire sensor light when the weather gets cold outside & the sliding doors don't latch open when windows are down. But small potatoes compared to other vehicles I have had. I have had this van for 16 months and have 40,000 miles already. No problems from this vehicle, nothing negative in my eyes about it. I love it and would definitely buy another without pause!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power! The ease of putting down or pulling up the rear seats for extra cargo space. The safety rating and reliability. Automatic turning off of lights to preserve battery if left on, or door left open (which the kids do at times). Automatic door lock once taken out of "Park", window locks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The acceleration on this van will knock your hat off. The ride is very smooth and quiet. Fun to drive. Fuel economy is good: 20 city, 23 hwy. Cavernous space inside fits our family of 7 and all our stuff easily. For hauling, it fits a full size couch if you take out the middle row of seats out. (It's a trick to learn to take them out, but not bad once you do it a few times.) The big nose is a major bug magnet. The only issue we've had is tire pressure sensor error. Wife has drained the battery three times by leaving lights on... but it fully recharges and works like new. Overall, we're highly satisfied and would purchase again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I reluctantly entered the mini-van world last year. I thought that my life had lost all meaning. However, the Toyota quickly restored my faith. I have always had Hondas and Toyotas and the Sienna is by far the nicest riding vehicle that I have ever owned. Most comforting, given this difficult transition from car to van, was that the Sienna is also the fastest minivan on the planet by a long shot - 0-60 mph in a little over 7 seconds is not too shabby-leave Honda and Nissan owners in the dust. Surprisingly good fuel economy for a vehicle this size (25mpg average). Toyota build quality is the best. Only service problem we have had was that the digital clock.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We narrowed our search for a good big family car down to the Toyota Sienna XLE or the Honda Odyssey equivalent level. We bought the Toyota, and in the first 6 months had to have the CD changer replaced 3 times! One tire won't hold air steadily, the paint chips very easy, the key transmitter needs replaced and no matter how and where we drive we can't average better than 18 mpg. Our dealer takes care of the problems under the warranty, but we loose much time having to go there and wait for repairs on a new car. Our conclusion is the building quality for the price does not match and we are now considering trading in for a Honda Odyssey.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nearing one year with 2007 Sienna, 18k miles. Great room for kids and all that comes with them. Drives nice, with lots of power. Handling not so great, breaking a bit scary at times due to the soft break pedal. Interior quality is not so Toyota-like; needs refinement with attention to materials and finish. A/C needs more power to the back seats. I would like to say the gas mileage is better then I thought. We're getting around 22-23 MPG combined and the added power is nice to have during traffic in/outs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the Sienna Minivan, but Toyota's fit and finish stinks. Three days after buying the minivan the 6 disc cd changer failed, had to wait a month for a new one. Next was the front driver and passenger door panels get stuck on the door sill and pop off. The rear power outlet, fell out of the side panel, and does not reset in the hole. None of the dash board pieces fit evenly, too many big gaps. Last is the Michelin tires seem to wear fast, but that might be due to wheel spin.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the van 6 months and had to be in the shop every other month. First the battery died and I had to drag the van out of the garage with 5k miles. Then the tire sensor had to be replaced, check engine light comes on, electric motors jumpy, rear latch broke and the door wouldn't even open. All this with 10k miles. I bought a new vehicle so my wife (works nights) and small children would have a reliable vehicle and I wouldn't have to worry. Now I have to spend a Saturday taking it to the shop. Can't get rid of it because the dealer says I still owe more than it is worth. Can't wait to see what happens next!</TEXT>

<TEXT>First year my battery died off, first year had a new transmission to my XLE limited edition. Year and a half, had a new ac compressor. Third year, starting to have problems with my transmission again. I bought the vehicle brand new. I just can not believe this. I think very highly about Toyotas: there quality is the best.

<TEXT>Many, many problems with the interior of the car. Middle passenger side seat is a "lemon seat" seat belt is major issue, 5th time trying to resolve. A/C system airflow distribution disproportionate in the bi-level and floor level settings. Rear air conditioner and heat appear to not be cooling and barely heating. Radio defective, speaker blown 2x, tire pressure sensor broken, side mirror control fell into dash, base of lemon seat cracked, handle of same seat broke, over head light broke over this seat, rear bumper came loose, tires are bald at 25K miles,air bag indicator light malfuntioning. I cannot believe the problems we're having.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the Sienna XLE Pkg #6 (nav, DVD, etc) in May. Have 9.5K on it now. Took 3,000 mile road trip in September. Very comfortable. Mileage averaging 18 mpg. Not one problem. New 3.5L V6 is great,. The Sienna's not as cool as the Odyssey and is a bit boring to look at, but it's reliable, comfortable, quick, and my wife is happy (after all, what else really matters?). </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got this vehicle because I needed something that was more family friendly than the 04 Tacoma standard cab that I traded in. I didn't want to take a hit in gas mileage, so this minivan ended up being the best choice, compared to SUVs, etc., that could still haul things. With an EPA rating of 26 hwy, I expected to get somewhat less, but I have been extremely pleased with the Sienna. With my mixed commute driving (about 100 miles/day RT, I average 28-29 MPG. Way beyond expectations. I am a conservative driver, but I do the speed limit. Flat out highway only driving, I actually get in the low 30s at 65-70 MPH (according to the mileage display). And, it will hold more than the Tacoma did!</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you have to move people, cargo or even your pet goldfish, why would anyone buy anything but a minivan? SUVs play to the ego but minivans play to the practicality. I use my minivans for business and have found nothing better to move equipment and people. I've also owned many kinds of minivans and until now thought they were pretty much all the same. But not this time. Toyota tops them all. It drives with incredible stability, small turning radius, smooth riding and super easy to drive. If you own a minivan now and it's not a Toyota, it will be well worth your time to drive this around.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride, the disappearing seats, comfortable seating, lots of storage, the large area inside the car, all the bells and whistles (they are fun!), terrific radio, auto temp. controls (3 way), neat DVD, plenty of pep and of course...Toyota workmanship.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The resale, fit and finish, stability, reliability, transmission, engine, dash board views, and rubber/ plastic movement and sound surpass the other minivans. The Sienna is heavy duty family grade. We drove the Honda and it was really nice. But not as heavy duty as the Sienna. The Toyota is much studier and feels better on the road. We love this van and I swore I'd never buy one!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is hands down the best minivan on the market. Honda and Nissan don't even come close. First trip out we got 27.4 mpg while running the A/C. This van turns on a dime, better than our Honda Accord. Plenty of power to get you over hills. At 75 mph the engine is only running at about 2200 rpms. We test drove both the Nissan Qwest and the Honda Odyssey and neither come close to the 2007 Toyota Sienna. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a SUV, but wanted better gas performance and needed a big minivan. Very safe, side airbags and stability control. Loved the design over the Honda Odyess. But HATE the gas mileage. The best we get is 13-15 city, 23-25 hwy after 1,900 miles. First week of purchase was getting 8-10 mpg city. Expected better city and hwy. Questioning if I should have keep my SUV or considering going back to one. Drive is nowhere near "car like" but the wife is happy. She's the primary driver so I won't add my 2 cents in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Can't say enough good stuff about this automobile. Broke it in according to the manual (1000 mls) then took it to Niagara Falls and the hills of NY Finger Lake region, about 1800 miles. Great ride, great room, great comfort, great gas mileage. Consistent 20 city/26 highway (with air on at 65-75mph) plus lots of get-up-and-go when needed (love those 266 horses). For me the proof will be in this cars longevity. Our family buys a car and squeezes evry bit of usefulness out before "donating" it to the junkyard (usually about 12-15 years). With this recent jaunt, I have high expectations until that time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Sienna is a very smooth running minivan with minimal wind and road noise. It has excellent power, especially at highway speeds. The Xenon lights do an excellent job. The cruise control has 2 modes: regular and laser controlled and I am happy to have a choice. I dislike the 5 MPH speed increment on the cruise control and would much prefer a 1-mph adjustment. In the first 2,500 miles of gentle driving, I averaged 19.4 mpg (was hoping for a bit more). </TEXT>

<TEXT>We were pleasantly surprised to find the Sienna with better features, handling, HORSEPOWER, etc. less expensive than our previous van, 1995 Dodge Grand Caravan LE. It was also was less expensive than the comparably equipped Honda Odyssey, which made our decision for us. Quick comparison - Toyota has advantage in price and power, better stereo and of course,reputation for reliability; Honda (maybe) handles better, feels a tad more car-like and may have a slight edge in styling. We are extremely happy with this vehicle purchase, and our children love the backseats.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Sienna ride is improved greatly compared to the 2004 model we traded. The horsepower increase is noticeable. We frequently find ourselves loading six full sized adults in the Sienna only to have it function completely to our satisfaction. Our experience is an avg. 23 mpg under avg. driving habits. Fit and finish are what one would expect from Toyota. No appreciable road noise. No squeaks or other obnoxious sounds.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We like the VSC and TRAC. The dash lighting is a noticeable improvement over the 2004 model. We like the added 4 wheel disc brakes and the side air- bag curtains.

<TEXT>This is my third Sienna and my kids are grown! It hauls people comfortably and safely. It hauls bicycles and is a changing room at ski resorts. I keep the middle row of seats out and it's convenient for loading everything. I fold the back seats down and load my 4 x 8 foot sheets of plywood for my workshop. Basically there is nothing this thing can't do well. People need to get over the soccer mom stigma of mini vans and the Sienna in particular.

<TEXT>Always hated Toyota, but after Dodge experience only considered Honda and Toyota. Love driving this van. VERY comfortable, excellent feature, and feels very solid (in a good way, not like a tank). Because of the options we wanted, we had to go for the limited (pricey) and ended up getting the power 3rd row seat. That's a pain b/c it is much slower than manual and everything must be perfectly out of the way for it to work. Gratuitous technology, but we love the other features. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav system with BlueTooth. Easy to learn and use. Have loved integrated bluetooth for 3 years (prev. car). Laser cruise control is phenominal. Gained confidence fast.

<TEXT>This is my first mini van. I purchase the Toyota because it had the best ride and most power. I test drove five manufacturers. I am avg 23 MPG with a heavy foot. I have 3500 miles in 3 weeks (vacation trips). Only issues: the stereo is a little weak. The indash CD is nice, just the sound is not as good as I expected. It does play CDs the MP3 format. I have about 900 songs in the CD drive. The other issue, you can control the rear air fan speed from the front, but not the temp. You have to reach behind you and adjust the temp from the rear control. Not a safe thing, if the van is moving. I can do it, but I don't like to. Other than that, I absolutely love the van.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>VSC (stability control), TRAC (traction control). I have tested both and they work great. The power and ride are awesome. Fuel econ is as expected. I can move the middle seat, 2nd row forward for my daughter to be closer to me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought my wife her first brand new car, or, I mean "minivan". Drove the 2007 Honda Odyssey EXL-RES and the 2007 Mercury Monterrey. Both are nice vehicles, but neither can match the quality, power, and refinement of the Toyota. The Toyota interior quality is unmatched by the competitors. Remember, it's not a minivan!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Look and feel of the minivan overall. Ride quality and craftsmanship of the interior. Nice touches on the interior, doors lock when you put it in Drive. Plenty of space for the car seat. Love the 9 inch DVD player. Full side curtain airbags with ABS, vehicle stability control, and traction</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Handles well and is larger than the Honda. Test drove both vans and the Sienna was the best van at a much lower price. We have three small children and thus three car seats. The Sienna has ample room for all the kids and plenty of room for cargo. Roof rack is standard equipment which is also a plus. I would recommend this van to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New gear shift console and dash layout. The interior is very comfortable and has plenty of room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Coming from a twin turbo Audi, it was hard to swallow moving into a minivan, and my wife tried hard to talk me out of it. Considered monster SUVs QX56 et al, and the Odyssey, but I decided with the AWD available in the Sienna, it made the most sense. I ordered an 07 limited AWD, with Pkg# 2 & 4. So far, I love this "Sports Van". It rides almost as smooth as my wife's RX 330, and is quite ergonomically sensible. I know I'll be a fool if I expect the performance of the Audi, but the Sienna does not disappoint. It is brisk off the standing start, but where it shines is on the highway, where you'll need to pay attention to stay within the 15 mph of the speed limit. It's that smooth.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav system, dynamic cruise, limited bumper already covered in clear protective plastic to prevent chips. JBL stereo system is quite nice. Still have less that 600 miles, but I measured 22 mpg on combined hwy/cty. Power folding mirrors are very nice to squeeze into the garage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Handles like it is three times as heavy as it is, underpowered, interior could use some refinement. Overall unpleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nothing special about the Sienna.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It over all is a pretty damn good, safe, reliable, comforting car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the wood trim. The leather is nice. I like the automatic shift that is based on the Lexus RX, and the strength of the car.</FAVORITE>
