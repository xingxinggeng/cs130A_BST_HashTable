<TEXT>After driving an 06 SL55 AMG I traded my fully optioned and modified 04 CLK55 AMG for this fully optioned car with the 030 Performance Package. I had it less than a month when it was totaled on 12/31/08. I am so impressed by this car I bought an 07 SL55 AMG with the 030 and all options after the insurance claims were settled. For comparison I tested the 09 Shelby GT500KR, 09 Chev Corvette Z06, 07 BMW 650i convt, 08 BMW 550 Sport and an 08 SL550 Sport. I even considered an 08 CLK63 Black Series. Personally, I think the SLs are great cars that can do everything very well. Although it is not as nimble as my previous 03 BMW M5 and 02 M3 its still my 1st choice. It's stablemate is a great 05 E55.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything and did I mention 510 HP, 531 foot pounds of torque mated to the 030 Performance Package? Wow, what a car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never would have paid the MSRP for this car new, but as a 2 year old lease return with less than 15K for 50% of MSRP, it seemed reasonable. The balance of performance and luxury/comfort is very impressive. It's very comfortable as a luxo- cruiser, but only a short throttle stab away from a rear-end sliding beast. I've had BMW's and S-version Audi's before, and this time I looked at used AM Vantage's (poor warranty) and M6's (sorry - just not very attractive), and considered 911's as well(yes, it's more of a sports car), but as a daily luxo driver in urban traffic that is still capable of lots of hard-top down, rip-snorting fun, this is a very tough car to beat....especially for 1/2 off!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The folding hard-top is a work of art to watch at work; SL55 is a great blend of aggressive performance and beautiful luxury in one package. Nice job, MB! The first MB I've owned, but not likely to be the last.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The power of 510 ponies cannot be beat when you're behind a truck, along side a slow poke, or just dying to feel the wind in your hair. Tons of truck space, all the bells, tolerable gas mileage, and fun, fun fun. Just wish people didn't park right next to me all the time! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Due to its active suspension (ABC) it can cruise like a S-class but it stiffens up for almost no lean in the fun twistees and corners-Amazing! The transmission senses when you need punch and adjusts to your driving style by the second-a great feature since your driving reactions can be so dynamic in today's crazy traffic. You can adjust the way the car handles from comfort to sport (including ride height) with a push of a button. The 7 speed auto- transmission can also be changed from comfort to sport for that all-out sports car performance. Great V8 engine- very smooth but has incredible low range torque and all the power you might want.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hard-top lowered or raised in about 16 seconds. Very effective wind management with the top down.The articulating rear window rotates to snug up to the roof maintaining over 7 cu/ft of storage in the trunk. The trunk is pretty large with the top up with over 10 cu/ft + 6 more behind the seats.</FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>The 7 speed auto-transmission can be changed from comfort to sport for all- out sports car performance. Great V8 - very smooth with incredible low range torque and power.

<TEXT>This is my third SL-class car I have owned in the past 3 years. I would have never gotten an SL55 except for the large price mark-down from the sticker since this is a lease return. This car obviously has the most power (510 hp), and thus the first time I floored the pedal, I said "WOW." This car does move. The motorized hard top is definitely cool, and makes the car versatile. It is also luxurious inside. Finally this car is expensive. Thus fun, fancy and frivolous. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2007 is a much better vehicle than my 2003SL. While the styling is similar, the new 7 speed transmition is fabulously smooth, the additional horsepower of the 550 vs. the old 500 is very noticable and the handling greatly improved. Also improved is the breaking which has eliminated the annoying "cluncking" sound and hesitation experienced in the 2003. Still a problem seems to be the computer system operating the ABC (active body control system). It was a constant problem with my 2003 and unfortunately has once more shown up on my 2007. The car was in the shop for 2 weeks while the computer part was flown in from Germany. Aside from this one electrical problem, the car is fantastic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I say "near" because the audio and nav system perform and look like equipment several generations old. Programming involves unnecessary steps, the screen is bland with minimal color levels, and it completely washes out in sunlight which obviously is a detriment in a convertible. The system won't even provide street labeling unless fully zoomed in to max detail. The radio functions are only average and sound is mediocre. The system needs more speakers with improved sub woofers and tweeters. To make up for these deficiencies the interior and exterior is a work of art. Coupled with the increased power and improved handling it's near automotive nirvana on a warm Sunday top down drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine power and torque provide great acceleration and the improved steering makes you feel like you're hard wired to the car. Watching the top perform its contortion act is great entertainment. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a Lexus SC430 leased for the last 4 years and I had been looking for a relacement. The Lexus was my first experience with a Non North American car. It was fun for a long time but did not give me the real sports car feeling. My Silver/red int. SL550 with AMG sport pack, and Pan Roof is a dream. Great power, very responsive, performance and handling is superior. The gas mileage is about the same as the SC430, but I have almost 100 more HP, much better handling and it's more fun to drive. I had tried the Jag, the BMW 6 and the Porsche but settled on the SL550. After 4 months I know I made the right decision. </TEXT>

When you add in the superb fit and finish of the car, the amazing hardtop convertible, some of the sweetest exterior looks on the road, and this car is just fun to drive.

<TEXT>This is the best roadster I have ever driven. I've owned Lexus, Corvette, NSX, BMW, and most recently the '07 Jaguar. The SL 550 is vastly superior to them all. The SL has an incredible combination of sport and luxury. The interior is as nice or nicer than anything out there. The car handles superbly, and yet still has a very comfortable ride. The seats are among the best I've ever seen. You can easily drive all day without killing your back. The only drawbacks to the SL are the price, poor mileage, and, inexcusably, a very mediocre stereo and outdated NAV. But the superior driving experience more than compensates for these shortfalls. Drive one, it's worth the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up the silver SL550 with the AMG sport package, panoramic roof and red interior Thursday, Aug. 17. 2006. I turned in my leased 02 Lexus SC430, which was the best car I ever owned for quality and fun. At this point, 1200 miles, I am still pinching myself. Awesome performance and I love just to stare at it. The gas mileage I had read was bad, but already I don't notice any difference from my Lexus 430 V8. The only thing I miss from the Lexus is the tilting down rear view mirrors when reversing.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I previously owned a 2005 SL500. The car is indeed more powerful reflecting the increase in horsepower. I actually do not like some of the minor interior changes. For instance, I do not like the change in the hard-top controller handle-switch. The previous switch had a red light incorporated in it to indicate when the up or down function was complete. The current switch no longer has this light indicator, and now you must turn your head around to look. I cannot figure out if the current model has voice control or not, while the '05 model voice control was standard. I do like the bluetooth module allowing use of your personal phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 07 SL 55 has subtle but great improvements over prior model years. The paddle shift is much better than the button set up on the prior AMG. The ride with 19 inch rims is very smooth for a performance car. Best of all it is somewhat stealth, at least here in So Cal as there are so many SL's running around. My only disappointment is that the navi is still somewhat behind that of Acura and the sound system is good but not great. In a $130 K car you would think the sound system would be as good as the exhaust "sound". All in all this is a dream car and feel lucky to own one. Prior car was an 02 E55 and still love it but not a much as this SL 55 Duh!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Stylish. Average MPG 11. Cheap vinyl visors. Sits low, getting in/out hard. Average quality leather. Terrible navigation. Command system is technology from 80's Radio Shack computers. Outdated 6-cd changer. Unless you keep A/C on auto (which gets loud) awful mildew smell emits from inside car--unevaporated H2O in pump system. Some things don't work from 1st day like cupholder. Porsche & BMW = better handling but SL550 better than SC430. Interior leather & wood & ergonomics are better in Lexus by far! but are better than 911 & 650i. Sound system: 1=sc430, 2=BMW & Infiniti, 3=911 & SL550. Build quality sub-par, very bad. You buy this car for sense of prestige not because it's the best- it's not</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Glass roof (panorama)--Cheap, flimsy sunscreen though. Fast (16 sec) convertible hardtop--can't drive while operating it like Porsche 911 & BMW 650. 12 posititon, Ventilated seats w/massage. Tiny compartment underseats for storage. Trunk closer button. Groove on gas-lid for gas-cap. Good windscreen.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a 2007 Jag XK for the SL. The Jag is beautiful, the SL is not only gorgeous, it is awe-inspiring when driving. It is more responsive, has a better ride, more power, and better seats--and--it has a hard top that looks great when up. I've owned Lexus, Range Rover, NSX, Corvette, and several Jags and several BMWs--the SL 550 is head and shoulders above them all--it is absolutely the most fun of any car I've ever driven--and that includes the new Aston Vantage V8. The SL is nimble,corners flat, is fast, and somehow still maintains a very comfortable ride. I highly recommend it. The only drawbacks are the price and the mediocre gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The way the car drives. It is incredible.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>A better SL</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This is my third SL since the new style was introduced in 2003. The 2007 model is the best I have driven to date. Everything in the car is updated and refined. If Mercedes quality whent down a bit, it is back to a higher standered with the 2007 edition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The increased horsepower gives this car the extra acceleration it lacked before. The cornering foglights are a pleasent surprise and work very well. The bluetooth phone is simple to use and works perfectly, even with the top down, at all speeds.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driving doesn't get any better than this. The new SL550 is markedly better than the car it replaced (the SL500). I've owned 2003, and 2005, SLs and the 2007 is a much better performing car</TEXT>
