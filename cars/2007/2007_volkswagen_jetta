<TEXT>Purchased this 07 Jetta 2.5L 5cyl 2 yrs ago brand new, has been a very good car, handles great on highway. Have had to replace the gas tank door on warranty. The bad thing is I have to buy the Catrol full synthetic oil at AutoZone along with filter for local mechanic to change the oil. Love the 10k mile oil change intervals. This car has been A++ excellent compared to our old 2003 Passat which was a nightmare (since assembled in Germany, compared to the Passat in Mexico). Car is very sporty & sometimes catches people's eye.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue inside gauges for speedometer & RPM's, nice body style for these year models. Love the low profile tires and 17" 5-spoke rims. Nice sporty style. Car seems it's going to do really good in the long run (so far!!) Love the rear air vents for A/C heat for back passengers, aux input jack for ipod!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third VW and my second GLI and it has not disappointed. I love the car and even the bright yellow color (though it wasn't my first choice). One of the other reviewers (a fellow Nebraskan) had trouble in the snow. I have not. I bought snow tires for the winter and didn't have any trouble at all. The DSG transmission would get 'stuck' when first starting out in very cold temperatures, but otherwise no mechanical problems at all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage! This car is fast and fun, yet still gets 24 city and 30 hwy. Not bad for as much fun as it is!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a 2007 VW Jetta and I have to say that I have had the worst experience possible with this car. I have had the fan replaced with in the first year of purchase, rear rotters and brake pads replaced (only at 43,000 which cost $400). I have had electrical problems with the vehicle numerous times. Had to take it in for repair when the transmission started slipping out of gear. For some strange reason the tires had issues holding pressure even though VW said nothing was wrong... but yet the tire pressure light kept coming on. The dealership gave me a list of what they call normal maintenance for 43,000 miles. Here it is: Pollen Filter, Gas Filter, Spark Plugs ect.ect. $2,000 total! Hate car</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had to replace pads and rotor only at 15K miles. Dealer said that this is normal. I just think 15K is still not that much miles to worry about your brakes. My other cars usually get up to about 30K to 35K miles. The repair is also very costly. $419. This is my first time to own a VW and probably my last too. The car drives great though but maintaining it would be quite expensive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car for the price. I bought it pre-owned and consistently drive it everyday. The car now has 38,000 with no problems (knock on wood).The steering on this car is tight and hugs the road. None of the other cars I test drove such as, the mazda3 and corolla could compare to the solid feel the Jetta has. This is a classy looking car and it turns heads, not to mention it's fun to drive. If you want a good looking car with style and great steering, get this car-you won't be sorry! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car for 25,000 trouble free miles now and have enjoyed all the car has done for me. Installed drop in k&n filter in place of factory filter and this helps car to breath better and gives car better tip in throttle response, especially when a/c is in operation. Replaced rear pads at 23,000 miles which should be covered under warranty but is not. VW needs to cover this issue under warranty. As long as you take your vw to dealer to be serviced, and drive it in low rpm range when cold you should not have problems with this car, as I have had no problems with my previous jettas. Also volkswagens aren't supposed to stand and warm up, drive off immediately after starting!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall the car has been reliable, but several problems have developed. First, it developed a bad smell due to mold in the A/C condensor. Lysol didn't work so I had to take it apart and clean it with bleach. Now we turn the A/C off a few miles before arriving at our destination and let the condensor dry. Then the lifts on the trunk wore out, which means the lid doesn't automatically open anymore. The third problem is a mild ticking sound from an exhaust manifold leak. It's not too bad since I can only hear it when accelerating moderately onto the freeway. Fortunately, it doesn't appear to be getting worse. I'm debating if I should take it to the dealer, lest something else get screwed up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power is adequate and can be prone to smoking the tires for some distance with the ESP traction control off. I found this out by accident one day when I decided to see if the ESP made any difference. I think the car is more fun with it turned off. What do you think:) Car has lots of cool features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my dads car. I drive it all the time, but i also drive my moms 2007 rabbit which I prefer to drive. The Jetta just doesn't stop like the rabbit at all. And it doesn't accelerate. The steering is almost the same but not quite as good as the rabbit. Overall I think that it is a good car but not great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my first VW Jetta and it rocks, the Wolfsburg Edition is really handy with the heated seats. At first I thought I had no reason to have them until I turned them on during a cold front. I tell you, you can't have leather seats without them. The same goes for the sunroof, at first I thought I've never had one so who cares, but now that I have used it is a great option to have. Thanks VW for the hard work in creating and evolving the Jetta for today's environment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first VW since owning a Scirocco in the late 80's. We have the 2007 Jetta Wolfsburg Edition with the 6-speed automatic. We love the styling, ride, power and fuel economy of this car. But in the terms of safety, this car is fantastic with front and rear side curtain airbags. I hope we will not have to use them but if so, they're there. The power is quite adequate and we have already taken a few trips in this car and the ride is quite comfortable. Also, the heated seats are a very nice edition on those cold days. The rear seat and trunk room are very nice as well as we love to travel and can fit much luggage in the cavernous trunk. All in all, this car is a great addition. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Simply put, this is a car of great compromise. This is my first VW. I wanted to reduce my operating costs due to rising fuel prices in the middle of 2006. Therefore the Jetta was considered. I am really glad I got one. It will be used as a commuter car that will get 100 miles per day put on it. As of today it has about 8,000 miles. I am getting 28 MPG (mostly freeway 72 MPH average with cruise control and regular unleaded). I use Mobil 1 synthetic (0- 40 wt) oil. Although the 5-cyl. engine lacks a little torque in the low RPM range, the 5 valve head runs pretty decent if you need to put your foot in it (above 3,000 RPM). I am 6' 1", 205 lbs and find the Jetta to have great comfort. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The satellite radio, smooth transmission, great ride, roomy trunk. nice interior design, easy to change oil/filter, easy reset maint computer. My son-in-law enjoyed the guitar for Christmas. I am glad to find nice people at VW, since Honda was acting too arrogant for me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I searched for my first new car, I had focused on Honda, as I have had good experiences with Hondas previously. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the VW Jetta. It is small on the outside and big on the inside, there's plenty of space for passengers and storage. It's a lot of fun to drive. The only drawback it has is it gets lower gas mileage than I would like. I can justify this by attributing the lower gas mileage to a heavy car body, which serves as an excellent safety feature.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is really a great car - it is fun to drive, has a very smooth ride, and handles turns and corners very well. It picks up speed very fast and the Tiptronic transmission is great for people who like to drive. I am very impressed that Volkswagen has taken the initiative to make so many safety features standard and my insurance went DOWN after purchasing a brand new car. It is great - I love the styling and it's just a lot of fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car and was happy with it until I started driving it further than a few blocks and winter came. It has no comfortable seating position. Also, the defroster does not heat the bottom part of front window, which leads to snow and ice buildup under the wipers. The transmission whine makes it sound like police are always present, when it's not grinding its gears. I used to have a V6 and the average gas mileage on that was nearly 20% better than I get on this car (though EPA ratings show it the other way around).</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a very good deal. It comes with ESP and all of the safety equipment, top crash and dynamic safety ratings for $17,500. I like the car overall. Its front seat comfort is only so-so for me, but the ride is very good. Its performance is fine, but its gas mileage is just OK. Nothing feels better at highway speeds (any speed you choose) than a VW. That makes them great cruisers. For the money it's quite a deal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has excellent fit and finish with upscale materials. The poor man's BMW is back with Class. Our other car is a Chrysler 300 and the Jetta has a smoother, quieter ride. We went with the 5-speed for the sports sedan fun, but the auto transmission with sports shift was a strong contender. The exterior styling is a little bland, our neighbor thought it was a Corolla and it reminds me of an old Altima. It has a smooth shift, but the quiet engine makes it easy to stall. Ironic huh? The multi-adjustable console/armrest is great. So far I would choose this car all over again. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The color combo...black with beige leatherette is very stunning. The seats are very comfortable, they hold you in place with good lumbar support. The great crash test ratings a plus in the Jetta. This car has solid road handling and pulls you through the curves. It has a great rear view mirror. The interior red/blue instrument lights are easy to see.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Jetta Wolfsburg is similar to the 2.5 trim, but adds a sunroof, convincing faux leather seats, rear center armrest, alloy wheels, and floor mats in addition to the cold weather package. It is available in black, white, silver, and gray. Its understated exterior styling belies the quality of the interior. It's even more impressive at night. Soft touch materials are used extensively, and even if you find hard plastic, it has a solid, quality feel. The exception being the paper-like shift boot. The ride is firm yet very compliant, excellent road manners. Its acceleration is acceptable from stop, but highway passing is effortless to a flaw - watching for flashing lights is compromised by rear visibility. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is amazing for a car that costs less than $20,000. I like the ambient red lighting at night. It has substantial passenger and cavernous luggage room (bigger than my previous Taurus). I like the torquey, great sounding engine. All-in-one package with no options needed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is stunning to look at and has loads of power, with the Tiptronic transmission and sports mode providing a whole lot of thrills. It has a surprisingly spacious interior and more than enough room for three sets of golf clubs. The standard 6 disc sound system is impressive and the leatherette seats are almost as good as the real thing (and far better than cloth). The fuel economy is excellent. It's a lot of fun to drive and can fit into virtually any parking space. I'm seriously considering buying another one for my wife.</TEXT>

It's been a year since I purchased my spice red Volkswagen Jetta and I'm still very pleased with my decision. Although it was not my first choice, I find it to be a beautiful car that is strong and enjoyable. On a separate note, the dealership is not as helpful. It is the only dealership that offers Jettas in my area, so I have no choice. The service department has been very rude to me on one issue. Still, overall I love my car. ;)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really like this car, I think the exterior styling which is considered bland by some is sort of sporty and elegant and it shares the same large chrome grille feature as VW's luxury counterpart, Audi. The car handles very well and I have the base 2.5L 5-cylinder engine which may not be race car fast but does the job. I notice that the car is very heavy for its class and I like this as it helps keep the car feeling more stable at highway speeds. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car drives and handles well. It's fun to drive and is nicely appointed, but it's the most expensive Jetta package, costs over $25,000. Trading in a '01 V6 fully loaded Passat, I didn't want to give up any extras. The new styling is great, and the upgraded 17" wheels make the car stand out. I did not test drive the car on the interstate before buying...big mistake. The road noise is very noticable, much louder than what I'm used to. I keep turning up the radio to compensate. If I had it to do over, I probably would have looked more at a midsize car and checked for a quieter ride. If you're looking for a small car and can get past the road noise, it's a nice car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have leased this Jetta and I think it is a great-looking car and fun to drive...when it isn't snowing or wet. I'm not sure what the issue is. I've driven in NE snow/weather for 20yrs and this is THE WORST car I have had for snow. If there is some magic button I need to press, I wish someone would let me know. The dealer here is terrible...it takes forever to get an oil change. My trunk lift broke 4mos after getting the car, and the dealer had the nerve to ask "what did you do to it?" Like I took a bat to it or something. They weren't going to repair the foot long scratch to the paint on the inside of the lid because "it didn't show".

<TEXT>About six months after I bought my car (my first car ever), the splash shield separated from the bumper and crumbled into a million pieces on the freeway. I took it to the dealer, and they said that my insurance should pay for it and that this happens all of the time because the European make of the car causes it to catch on US parking curbs. I went to my insurance agent and they said they weren't going to pay for it, because it wasn't due to an accident. I had to pay $1800 in repairs out of my own pocket. I have since had problems with my driver's side door, and my brakes almost didn't stop my car on a hill. Expect to apply a large amount of pressure on your brakes to stop at high speeds!</TEXT>

<TEXT>As I read through the reviews, I agree with the brake issue. I had to replace my rear left brake system completely at about 10K miles. The rear caliber seized and wore down my pads and bent the rotors. I am now close to 18K and having another brake issue. I have had 2 other cars of which I put well over 100K each and did not run into this problem. If it were not for this problem, I would say the car is great. Awesome handling and great pickup.

<TEXT>Not a bad car overall. But I guess some lucky few (including me) have experienced defective brakes. I had to replace the rear pads and rotors at 21,000 miles and now again 9,000 miles later! VW claims this is normal wear and tear. I've owned and driven many cars and never had to replace pads, let alone rotors before 40,000 miles. There is no brake wear indicator light for the rear brakes, only for the front. The rotors are designed so that they have to also be replaced every time the pads are replaced. Very expensive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>overall a nice car if you don't mind paying 300+ every 15,000 miles to replace rear pads and rotors</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall the car is ok. I'm one of the unlucky few that has brake problems. I had to replace the rear brakes and rotors at 9,849 miles. I'm still fighting to get it done under warranty. The brake sensor is only for the front brakes so you will find out too late that your rear brakes need replacing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving some Japanese makes (you can imagine which ones), I finally made it to the VW dealer, and it felt like I had been driving go- karts all day! This felt so solid and drove so well. I loved the tiptronic transmission and the VW signature blue and red display on the dashboard! The mileage this car gives is also very respectable. This was the last car I test drove. The 6'6" salesman opened the driver's door wide open when we got back to the dealer, hung himself from the door for about 7 seconds, and then closed the door. It closed as if nothing had happened. He looked at me, smiled and said: "Do not try this on a Japanese!" I thought this was a funny remark. I love my Jetta!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been reading everyone's reviews about how they love this car. Personally I have not had a good experience. I have had a knocking noise that sounds like it is coming from the dash on the passenger side that sounds off every 1 min and 15 sec. The airbag warning light stays on, the brake warning light stays on, the signal warning light stays on, and periodically the power steering light comes on and the steering acts crazy. I have already replaced the rear brakes at 20,000 miles when supposedly the rear brakes only get used 25% of the time. I have already been to the dealer twice. I need a car that I can depend on as a single mother and this car is definitely not it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is MY first VW, and my family's twelfth, so I am a little biased on my love for the car. The fit and finish is luxury level, the ride quality is (for me) close enough to my old 3- series BMW that I can't justify the added expense of the BMW anymore. The only complaint I have is the rear brakes which seems to be a common complaint here. I will say this though, having had to replace the pads nearly every oil change, I will continue to pay for that hydraulic braking system. That braking system has saved my life on LA freeways more times that I care to admit! This is one of those cases of parts bin engineering but when your parts bin is "hand-me-downs" from Porsche...</TEXT>

<TEXT>The rear brakes are design to be replace (Pads + Rotors) every 15,000 miles no matter how much you use them. I use this as a commute car and I will never buy a VW again because of this issue. I like the car but I can NOT believe that VW has this problem and will not correct it. This is an on going problem from the 2000. If you hear a thud in the rear brake area you have a problem that will cost you $400.00 because you have to replace the ROTOR and PADS. This is not something on a car any brand or model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 5th Jetta and there are a few major issues. The car failed to start 3 times and the alarm went off in the middle of the night for no reason. It was an electrical short that took 3 trips to the dealer to fix. The last time it was there for 5 weeks!!! The center console "handles" crowd the drivers right leg and they serve no purpose! The gas mileage is not the best/or worst but for mileage this low I want a car that is faster. The acceleration is adequate however and I enjoy the fit and finish of the interior and exterior. The trunk and back seats are roomy. Besides the mechanical issues I like the handling. I will not however be purchasing at the end of my lease.</TEXT>

The car is a lot of fun to drive, looks great and is comfortable. The interior quality is impeccable-on par or better than BMWs and Audis. I've driven it 7,000 trouble-free miles so far, and hope it stays that way. I am admittedly still holding my breath waiting for a problem to pop up- hopefully this VW will prove me wrong!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was somewhat hesitant to purchase a VW because of everything I had read regarding the quality of the car, but I was pretty much sold after a test drive. The 2.0T has much better performance, exterior styling, in addition to what I believe is higher quality interior materials than the other cars I was considering (e.g. Accord, Camry, Altima). The only weakness I can see so far is the fuel mileage and the car's requirement for premium gas. The car has been averaging about 22-23 mpg in mostly city driving. While this is in line with the EPA ratings I had expected better. I haven?t done any long distance highway driving with the car yet so I can?t comment on the highway performance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 4th VW. The Jetta is our first "new" VW. It handles beautifully and has enough power to get into traffic. Test drove a Corolla and Camry the same day we tested the Jetta and the Jetta won hands down just due to the fun factor. Only problem so far is the door latch on the drivers door catching, and the outside temp gauge. It uses a little more gas than we expected, but the alternative wouldn't be much fun to drive. The sport shift is great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Jetta, 3rd VW in all. My '98 Jetta got well over 30 mpg. My '07 averages 18 mpg! I've been back to my dealership 4 times and they basically tell me 'too bad'. I contact VW Corporate and they told me I have to work with the dealership, and that Corporate has nothing to do with it. Overall, I love the car, except the gas mileage and the lack of power (feels like 4 cylinders, not 5). I'm very disappointed in VW on the way they handled this issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a white Wolfsburg Edition with a tan leatherette interior and have been very satisfied. It has a quality, well insulated interior and the exterior resists chipping from pebbles very well. Although it can only muster a 17 second quarter mile time, it feels quicker in the lower gears thanks to the 6-speed auto. It also cruises effortlessly at 80 mph and has good passing power at freeway speeds. The car handles well with a firm but not too harsh ride. It also has very powerful brakes with an emergency brake assist system that has the ability to apply full braking force in case the driver does not. Overall the car has a solid quality feel to it and seems to be thoughtfully engineered.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought new on 8/31/07, returned 9/1/07 for my AC and heating not working. So far, VW has had my car for 2 weeks and expects to have my car another 3 weeks due to "production problems" for the part that my Jetta requires (sensor/compressor). They say this problem just started occurring in the 2007 models and they aren't equipped to handle the need for so many parts. I'm now sporting a Mercury Sable that I pretend is my Jetta :( Extremely disappointed in VW, but the time I did have it I enjoyed it.

Good throttle response and decent power from the 2.5 liter five cylinder engine/6-speed automatic transmission combo. No problem issues to report and the best highway fuel mileage so far has been 33.6 mpg keeping a steady 70 mph. At around 80 mph, the mileage is consistently 29-30 mpg. We've been averaging 22-25 mpg around town. We drove a lot of cars before settling on the Jetta for its cost, features, safety, comfort, and handling. The handling is perfectly stable at 80 mph on the interstate and yet nimble in town. Nothing else came close.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 1987 VW Jetta and I had the worst experience with it. I thought after 2 decades VW finally got better. Oh boy I was wrong. The 1987 was made in Canada and Mexico, and when it needed repairs I had to buy German parts at very high price to repair the car. Same story with the 2007 model. It's made in Mexico and the workmanship is VERY POOR. Just within 2 months the car started to fall apart. This car is a mechanical nightmare. No wonder more and more people buy Toyota. Just after 1 month the master cylinder (for brakes) needed replacement. 4 days ago, the car overheated on the way to Vegas. I made a huge mistake to buy this car.

The steering is excellent, and don't be fooled by the 150 hp; the torque more than makes up for it and gives plenty of passing power. This car has a very solid feel for such a little thing. My only disappointment with the Jetta is its gas mileage. I've observed about 21/25, which is a bit inferior to other cars like the Civic or the Accord. Overall I am more than willing to make this trade off since I see a billion Hondas on the road every day, which makes me feel a bit more unique in my happy-looking Jetta. :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had the car for a few days now so these are my initial impressions. Look for another one by me in about 3-6 months. So I came over from a 2005 Volvo S40. The GLI performance and fun to drive factor is miles above the S40. The comfort and ergonomics are significantly less than the S40. Initial impressions: strong build quality (it sounds and feels very solid). Performance is fantastic. I love its style. I know it's very safe. Good visibility and great trunk space. The MFD (trip computer) is a bit confusing at first, it's not as user friendly as what I'm used to. Stereo has great features but sub-par sound (much better in Volvo). More details to come later - check back! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great solid car. You get the convenience of a sedan but with more personality and fun. It's roomier than previous models. Trunk space is great, and grocery hooks are handy. The tire pressure monitor is a plus. The low profile tires are a little sticky, so rides on the highway can be bumpy and uncomfortable for some. The premium fuel recommendation could be pricey even with the good gas mileage. I'm a little concerned with VW's past reliability history, but so far I've been pleased. I chose this over the Acura TSX because I like the sportier feel and its features for price. I actually don't mind the drive to work!</TEXT>

I'm getting about 29 mpg on the highway and with all the standard features and quality of the interior, I'll take the Jetta anyday.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for just under a year and just got hit today by a unattentive driver doing 50 mph. I and my car are going to survive. How many small cars can you say that about? I love this car - people complain about engine noise but it's not bad and the stereo system has a function to get louder (subtlely) as the speed increases so I never notice it. It is safe, stylish, fun to drive, and reliable. I haven't had any problems and after today when my car was being towed away to the body shop I realized that I love it even more now that I know it really does keep me safe. I would recommend this car to anyone and I love that VW took the initiative to make safety standard.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a Lincoln Continental for this. I think it was a good move. It was time for something smaller. Gas mileage is great. Pick-up is amazing. I got the drivetrain of a GTI with a more comfortable suspension. Seats are a good fit, driving position is near perfect. Brake pedal is a little too close to the gas pedal. Wide shoes become a problem. Radio sounds great. I like the MP3 jack. Should have had a recess in the glove box lid to allow cable to pass out without crimping it. The AC power outlet in rear of console was a pleasant surprise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In 6 months I realized how poorly designed it is and you get real concerned about the long term reliability of this vehicle. When you get into the driver's seat, you will always have to dodge the side bolsters. The car's ventilation system makes clicking sounds and this is normal according to VW. My car since the purchase date sometimes refuses to turn over when started, nothing wrong that VW could find. Trunk release does not open in cold weather. If you want an oil change, either buy your own filters or go back to the dealer, nobody stocks them. Gas fuel door was replaced under warranty as well as rear fender clip that holds bumper in place. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This an overall great car. My husband and I really like the boxy look from the back and the ground effects are subtle but make the car look great it gives it a fuller look. The seats are a little hard, I find my self adjusting the seat a lot to try to find some comfort and I just can't find it. I also wish they all came with standard steering wheel radio controls. The ride around town is great, but on the highway it gets kinda shakey. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Jetta thinking it was a German car that was pricey but worth the money due to the materials and workmanship. I am incredibly disappointed. When I picked up the car the keyless entry didn't work and the radio had interference. The dealer to date is unable to fix the radio. It sounds bad enough to drive me crazy and not terrible enough for the VW people to care. They replaced the radio once and it still is not fixed. Even worse I had to visit the dealership 7 times to have them keep trying to fix it. That is not including the 8 times for them to fix my keyless entry. I have only owned Hondas until this VW. I will never buy a VW again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I like the car but, they need to go back to the drawing board with the driver's seat. It is not comfortable if you have a short torso and I have to use a lumbar cushion if I drive very far. The seatbelt receiver is very low if you have to elevate the seat (it elevates up and forward) and it is so rigid (not like the flexible, higher version used for the passenger seat) that it causes the seatbelt "handle" to jab deeply into your hip and cause severe bruising. I am an average sized person and have never had this type of problem with any car that I have driven in 30 years. Be sure that you test drive the car with the seat adjusted to your fit and drive it around awhile. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is surprisingly quick for a base engine with automatic. The six speed trans is very smooth and is programmed perfectly. Handling is excellent and performance in snow is very good. The interior is very good, but I'm not sure I like the placement of the cruise control lever. Love the heated seats and chilled glove box. Sunroof is very well designed with little wind noise even at highway speeds. So far there have been no problems with any part of the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a used 1.8 Turbo (2003). My pleasure at owning this car led to the purchase of our new Jetta. I am greatly pleased with the handling and performance of the new Jetta. It does, however, seem so much "bigger" than the older car. The Tiptronic trans. is excellent, and snaps off manual shifts faster than any human could perform.One of the most impressive things about the car, is the build quality. Truly German, a poor man's BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My girlfriend works for Volkswagen & I was skeptical when she bought her 07 Jetta.I am a die hard Nissan/tuner enthusiast & I am amazed with the performance & smooth ride of German vehicles, in this case VWs Jetta.The car has great acceleration & good power considering its weight & remote 150hp, but could pack a punch when you need it to.The 6spd auto/DSG feature is great & the comfort, interior quality, & ride is amazing, not to mention the car is affordable.Black is the best color for the Jetta as it highlights all of its elegance & compliments the chrome front grille the best.I am in love & will be purchasing one for myself, the GLI of course.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great acceleration for only having 150hp, smooth & comfortable ride, interior gauges have an awesome color, and most importantly a best buy for the price compared to other vehicles within the same class, doesn't feel like you're driving a tin can like most of these imports-VDUB has found a new fan!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first "new" car. I also own a 1965 El Camino, and have been looking at new cars for three main reasons: 1) safety, 2) comfort, 3) gas mileage. This car was the only one that I was looking at in the $20,000 range that had full side curtain airbags for the driver, passenger, and rear seats. The bucket seats are very comfortable for long driving periods, and the car's estimated gas mileage is 22-30 mpg, though I find myself getting about 24-26 mpg on regular-unleaded. This is not my dream car, but for a college student who has a shallow wallet the price for what your getting is defiantly superior to comparable models.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car has good interior and exterior design features that pay attention to detail. For example, tap the blinker lever and the blinkers blink three times then disengage. This keeps my hands on the wheel and my mind on the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Jetta since 09/05. I have only had one problem with it, which was the truck latch didn't work all the time. They replaced it and I have had no problems since.

<TEXT>The Jetta Wolfsburg was a welcome choice among the many configurations of the Jetta. It has just the right combination of options for the price, and is substantially less expensive than if you put the same option packages on the regular 2.5. The car is adequately responsive in the economy driving mode, but shift into the sport mode and it becomes a MUCH more powerful animal. Living in California, I find the Tiptronic to be especially useful for keeping the RPMs up for easily passing other cars on the many freeway mountain passes. While the last generation body style was more inspired, the current Jetta's lack of exterior edginess is more than made up for with its SUPERIOR interior. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Looks can be deceiving! This car has a very uncomfortable ride. The seats are back killers. Whenever I drive the car for more than 30 - 40 minutes the middle of my back tightens up. I've never had back problems, but now whenever I drive the Jetta for more then 30 minutes, my back tightens up. Adjusting the seat hasn't helped. In 35 years of driving dozens of vehicles, this is the worst ride I have ever experienced. I wish I could sell it without losing my butt. VW's response was there isn't a design flaw. I'll never buy a VW again! </TEXT>

<TEXT>My Jetta Wolfsburg constantly surprises me. After the 1,000 mile break-in, my gas mileage was 34 MPG on my last trip. The car takes regular gas, not premium as noted in some articles. It has plenty of pep with the manual transmission. I drove an automatic five cylinder and was underwhelmed by it's performance. Do yourself a favor and buy the 5-speed. You'll save over $1,000 and have more fun driving. My last Jetta was an '03 Wolfsburg with the 1.8T. The 2.5 reminds me of my old Jetta, but the quality and reliability of the '07 has greatly improved.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car as an alternative to the GTI, GLI and Rabbit. The GTI and GLI were just too expensive when loaded up with the options I wanted while the Rabbit even fully loaded seemed lacking to me. The Wolfsburg Edition is a joy to drive, it handles as nicely as the others in my opinion, and even with the 2.5 has more than enough zip for me. I use it mostly for my commute to work, 25 miles one way and also to load up guitars in the trunk for repair work I do on the side. The trunk space is huge and can be expanded into the back seat area - a big plus for me, the main reason for the GTI and Rabbit was cargo space. This car gets about 30 mpg highway which accounts for most of my driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The console and dash lighting is awesome, with two small detail lights over the console to give some light while driving. The sport mode on the Tiptronic is to die for. The detailing of side panels and plenty of crash protection are a major plus for any car, this has both. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>VW's exterior and interior material are much better than those that are used in most import and domestic autos, but mechanically I think they need to improve. We are currently having issues with oil consumption of 1 quart of 5W-40 synthetic oil ($5-6) every 1,300 miles and a soft brake pedal on cold starts. VW claims that 1 quart per 1,000 miles is normal. I do not agree with this, I think they got this spec. from the VW Bug. The dealer and VW Corp. will not fix these problems. Please, do your homework before you buy any VW. Try http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ for consumer complaints before you buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded an '01 Cavalier with 136,000 miles on it for a VW Jetta Wolfsburg. My fiancee has an A4 Audi. These cars are very similar, but not the same. So far, other than the vanity light not working (dealer repaired), the car is great. It has lots of power, handles great, and it's comfortable. I wish it came in blue though. I think we are going to trade the A4 in on a Jetta GLI and save $6,000-$8,000. It just has no quattro AWD. I was leery about the car being built in Mexico. I was going to buy a Rabbit 4 door that was made in Germany, but for $500 or so more, I went with the Jetta and am glad that I did. I would not recommend the dealer though. They were typical BS artists with no product knowledge! I knew way more about all VWs than them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in my '01 Wolfsburg Edition for the new '07 model. The engine is solid; it whines a bit at low speeds but has enough juice. The lack of a Turbo takes some of the "fun factor" out of it. The old one had one, but the lack of a turbo but probably makes for a more reliable ride. The styling is OK, it's grown on me a lot since I first saw it. I used to think it looked just like a Corolla but now think it looks a bit more distinguished, especially in black. It has lots of thoughtful extras. Overall I am happy, it has modest power, convincing leatherette, a moonroof, a 10-speaker stereo and heated seats plus a good warranty for under $20,000. I shopped the Altima (great but more money), Civic/Accord, Camry, and Fusion. This was the clear winner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>They ditched the over-the-CD player dinky cup holders, and it doesn't smell like crayons. Popping the trunk actually pops it all-the-way open. The heated seats!

<TEXT>I love my new Jetta. All I have done to it is add a small Bazooka to have some punch to the music in the car. It drives great and feels like a tank compared to other Japanese cars that I had test driven prior to this one. To show me how well built it was, the 200 lbs. salesman hung himself on the door for 5 seconds, and the door still closed perfectly! He said: "Don't try this on a Honda." I thought that was funny. I love the Tiptronic automatic transmission and the sports mode, which gives me a pseudo-manual feel of a sporty driving experience. The rigid suspension helps in this as well. After test driving several makes and models, as soon as I drove the Jetta I knew that was my next car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the heated seats! It only takes them about 30 seconds to warm up, even when starting the car on a winter morning (I do have a garage, though). Also, I love the MP3 connection. The heated water for the wipers is a nice feature as well. All four windows go up or down when you press the button once.</FAVORITE>
