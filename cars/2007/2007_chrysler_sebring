<TEXT>Bought my Sebring 10 months ago with 20,000 miles. I have 40,000 now. I spend at least 2 hours a day in it. I am enjoying its drive, the sound system and have had no trouble at all.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I waited two years before writing review. Have had this car for two years almost and have had only two problems. First brakes had to be replaced after 10 months appox 11,000 miles. Dealer replaced pads, rotors no questions asked. Second a small bubble on dashboard when sun hits it. Great gas mileage 32 hwy 24 city. Very reliable, good acceleration on exprssway for 4 cly auto. Handles great snow rain. Don't drive it like a sports car and I think you will have this vehicle for a long time. First Chrysler product I have ever owned and happy I purchased it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sirus radio, quiet cab, firm seats are very comfortable, great looks</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this 2007 Chrysler sebring in 2997 with 25,000 miles on it. And this car has given me a lot of surprises and upsets. First in less than 1 year there were 2 recalls on the car, than just a few months a go the check engine light went on and now just 2 days a go it started over heating. I took it to the dealer but they couldn't find anything. This car is full of surprises in less than 2 years now and I am fed up with this. This might be the worst car that I ever had with this kind of problem. I only drive 30 miles a day and things like this is kinda considered stupid for Chrysler. Don't buy this car it only looks good but bad performance. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had this car for two years 25500 miles on it so far excellent. I have serviced it oil every 5000 rotate tires and get 32 hwy and 22 city. No problems except the rotors replaced at 12000 under warranty, gave me a loner for the day. Sirius radio is great. Handles in snow and rain wonderful,plenty of pickup getting on the expressway, love the styling and get compliments on it all the time. Its not a sports car, or muscle racer and but a daily driver so treat it as such and this auto will be very reliable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love it so far. First Chrysler I have ever owned would not hesitate to buy another. Best warranty, forever on drive train cant go wrong. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car I call the American version of the Yugo. In the six months my wife has had this car, the serpentine belt has been replaced three times, the air conditioner compressor has been replaced twice, the gear shift stuck in park when she parked on a slight incline, the front bumper has separated from the panels above because it is attached with flimsy bolts. The panel under the motor is missing, probably fell off on the highway somewhere. The interior is cheap plastic, noisy when it idles. Chrysler has been bailed out twice by the American taxpayer. Why? They can't sell junk cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Car stalls randomly when stopped. Dealer can find "nothing" wrong. Car occasionally drivings at 5000 RPM when doing only about 60 MPH. Again, dealer can find no cause, says there is "no code" so they can't help you. Offered me the option to turn it into the bank or use it as a trade (less than 1 year later for greatly less than I paid.) Would NEVER purchase form this dealer or this car EVER again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>i have had this car for almost 2 years now. when i was first going to buy a car for my wife i test drove many other models in the midsized sedan market. this one stood out for a few reasons, a great stereo and a long list of features this is the touring 2.4 liter model. first anyone who buys a car for reliability doesn't love cars or even car, they just want it to run so don't right a review. this car has had not had a single problem. don't drive it like you stole it and service it and it shouldn't. this car was cheaper than any of the other makes and looks way more expensive. it has more features and if you aren't reviewing the car like ze Germans then then you realize this is a nice car</TEXT>

<TEXT>Do not get me wrong this is a really good car, the only issue I have with it is the brakes. It seems that the braking system is not strong enough for the car, now that might be how they make cars today, but its not smart. I found out that I needed brakes (at around 10,000 miles) when I went to stop and the vehicle did not want to and then you heard a horrible grinding noise, only to find out that there was nothing left to the pads, they had worn down with no notification whatsoever, some saftey light would have been nice. Just something to consider.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got this car as a company vehicle last year July 2007. I have the 2.7L V6 engine. I must say, the car is very stylish from the outside but basically, car is a piece of crap! I took this car in several times to the dealership for various repairs. Problems that stand out for me is the following - Car dies intermittenly at low speeds. When making left turns, car makes a growling noise. At stops, sometimes car sputters, then surges forward when foot is on brake. If you don't have to drive it and leave it parked the car get 10's all around. Once you drive it the car gets 1's all around! I will never ever purchase a Chrysler product. No wonder the 3 big American car companies are going out of business!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 07 Sebring new, and put 25K miles in one year. In this time it only needed one minor fix to the trunk release. I have the 2.4l 4 cyl, and no issues with pep. I'm a bit surprised by some reviews that report lack of pep. I travel a lot, and have driven many rental cars with 4 cyl. engines. I don't think any of them have as much go or more power than my Sebring. On the highway it's quite and handles far better than I expected for the price I paid. On one recent highway trip I got 35 mpg doing mostly 70 mph. My only concern is if Chrysler will stay in business to honor the life time power- train warranty that came with my car for no extra cost! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I went to a Nissan dealership, and drove away with a Chrysler. I'm a college student, wanted to get something I wouldn't have to pray would break down on me. Test drove a few Nissans then I test drove the Sebring, and then took it home. I love the way the car looks. It's great on gas, and the sound system is great. People have been complaining about the pick up, I think the car is quite peppy, and when I'm on the highway I don't even realize how fast I'm going sometimes. The inside feels sorta like a airplane cockpit, but I love my car ! I love the gas mileage it rivals a Honda, or Nissan . Not bad for an American made car</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Sebring about a month ago. I absolutely hate this car. It sounds terrible. Never know what noises I'm going to hear each day. Kind of fun to drive but so noisy and uncomfortable it's hard to get past anything else. Please ask if you can take car for a few days and drive before you buy to make sure it's what you want. Wish I would have. Not fun just sick to my stomach that I'm in this car for a long time. I wish I could hire someone to run it off of a cliff. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased my Sebring when they were brand new to the showrooms. It was a great car that handled well, has great features like Sirius satellite radio, 6 in dash CD player and most importantly UConnect. I found it so much easier to use than the Trailblazer I had. The four cylinder engine had more than enough power to take us where we were going and in the year and a half I had the car, no problems to report. The greatest concern with the car is safety. The car was in an accident which rendered it a complete loss. The car was hit head on and the air bags never went off. Thankfully my children weren't in the car but I did suffer chest pain from hitting the steering wheel. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle a few weeks ago. Just got my license plate yesterday. I already want to return it. I love this car, especially the way it looks. But I'm already experiencing problems. Twice the ignition made a sound when cranking as if the starter was getting ready to quit on me and the brakes makes a funny noise only when I'm backing up. Now today it rained while i was at work and i hear water swishing around in the back, my husband says it sounds like it's coming from the back passenger door. It sounds like a LOT of water, not a little. Although i'm under warranty i think i'm going to return it and find me something else. Beware of the Chrysler Sebring!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We own a Ford Freestyle Limited and wanted something smaller like a Camry. I travel a lot and needed better gas mileage. I was amazed when I test drove the Sebring. So glad I did, it is great on gas and sporty! I had only owned Toyota's (2 Camry's, 1 Corolla) and and one Ford (which we still have)...I love this Chrysler. My two daughters are anxious to drive it when they are old enough - they liked the body style as much as I do. This car has been better than I expected.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car with less then 100 mi. Started having problems 2 days after I took it home. Had problems with the check engine light- had to replace the PCP. Had problems with the sunroof/spoiler. The car makes noises when you start it and power steering make cluck noises when you turn corners. Took it back to the dealership for the 8th time but they say these problems were just the way the car was built. Please don't buy this car unless you want a noisy car. Looks nice from outside but the engine sounds very loud. I just recently noticed a gaping crack where the bumper meets the rest of the car. Looks to be pulling away. Back to the shop it will go!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving the following vehicles Dodge Charger, Chevy Malibu, Hyundai Sonata, Mercury Milan (twin to Ford Fusion), Nissan Altima, Mercury Sable, I decided on the Sebring. Reason: best ride for the money. More substantial with better drive and road handling than the Sonata, Milan or Altima. The Charger and Sable are the only ones that could compare to the Sebring. The Charger is very solid but more money and less MPG. The New Sebring introduced in 07 is far better than the old Sebring with improved ride and handling. I purchase the Limited with the four cylinder 2.4 L engine. Good power for a four banger and far less noise that the Altima. </TEXT>

What a mistake. I have had nothing but trouble. I have had 4 water leaks in my car, and I don't mean little I mean about two inches of water in there. After the fourth time of this they think they have it fixed. My air conditioning has gone out twice and my blinkers blink even when they are not in use. My windshield wipers are tearing up my windshield for the third time as well. I know you are thinking oh she just got a lemon well the dealer said this is about the 15 car with the same problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for about 4-6 months & have had it to the shop a lot for electrical problems & broken seal on the radiator overflow. It is still under factory warranty as it only had 19,000 miles on it when I got it. Carfax had no bad reports on it at all. I am concerned about the electrical problems as they have had to replace the battery & 2 different electrical modules with the low number of miles on this. I am wondering what else might happen. It was a one owner car from Alaska & there are no records to see what problems they had. Do you think I might have a lemon? John</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an awesome car, inside and out. Very sporty looking and for a 4door family sedan, when paired with the 3.5 V6 and 6 speed automatic, you tend to forget your driving a family vehicle. The engine is whisper quite and provides plenty of pep around town and on the highway. Be careful 80 feels like 40. This is my third Chrysler in a row. Before these last three vehicles I was exclusively a European car buyer. I was originally in the market for a Pasat or Audi A4, but the value in the New Sebring Sedan was too much to pass up. Especially considering from the back it looks like an Audi and the side it looks like a BMW</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is simply a beautiful car, inside and out. Meant for being a boulevard cruiser rather than a racecar. Got the touring with every option except leather, and got the 2.7 V6 for the E85 capability. The engine, while somewhat slow, sounds really nice and refined, and the four speed shifts without making a fuss. This is by far the smoothest car I've ever driven/riden in (it is my dad's primarily), and 90 feels like 40. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the electroluminescent gauges, the tire pressure readouts, and the Boston Acoustics stereo- if anything makes this car fall apart it will be this- it is insane! Remote start is a great feature, both practically and for wowing friends. Stain resistant seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We decided to give the Sebring Limited a try as a midsize. The major imports we looked at seemed to be getting bloated and were just plain boring(No spark). The car is just the right size, has great styling and handles extremely well. Twisty roads are a real blast with the precision steering and suspension. The 3.5l engine has lots of power and has a pleasant tone when you get your foot into it. We've had the car for about 4 months now and it has been trouble free. The build quality is excellent and the interior design is pleasant and unique with high quality material. The seats are very comfortable. We're expecting great service out of this car like our old LHS, +100k and no troubles</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall styling and interior. The 3.5l engine is smooth and has an excellent history. Mileage has been improving steadily to 31 mpg highway. Still breaking it in. Mixed driving with many secondary roads is 23.5 mpg. It is easy to get in and out of. Just a great design with great execution.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A Sebring wasn't even on my next car list several years ago but the redesigned 2007 changed all that. I bought the 3.5L V6 for better performance and, combined with the 6- speed autostick, it doesn't disappoint me. I think it has every option except the moonroof, which I didn't want anyway. I love the Inferno Red color with the chrome accents and the interior with the MyGIG navigation system looks sharp. Little things like the nice, solid sound and feel of the door closing tells me it's a quality built car. It is so quiet and smooth on the highway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto everything - too much to list. My favorite is the MyGIG navigation system. The hands-free voice command for the radio, nav and bluetooth connect cell phone is fun. The hot/cold cupholder is a nice touch. The two-stage heated seats and remote start come in handy on cold nights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I felt this was a great buy. I was looking for a good solid car that was good on gas. Being a Chrysler minivan owner I was a little more inclined to be less harsh on the product because I had such good luck with my van. But with that said the Sebring surprised me on looks inside and out. The equipment I have on the car that listed for $22,400. So far it has exceeded my expecatations </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heat seats and remote start are my wife's along with the safety features. My daughter loves the sound system and the sporty style of the car. I like the safety features and the peppy 4cyl.

<TEXT>When looking for a new car I happened upon the Sebring. I started looking at it just for the styling. Then I drove one and fell in love with it. It is a lot of car for the money. I just don't like to buy anything but American and this in my opinion is the best mid-sized American car for the money. I liked the 2.7L V6 in the Touring with it's E85 capability and the 18-inch wheels are definitely a plus. It rides like a much more expensive car and it very quiet on the interstate when cruising at 82mph. I am very happy so far with 522 miles driven, hopefully many more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first full tank of fuel averaged me 37 mpg. That is way more than I expected. I like this car for its solid feel and good handling, inside trim, non glare dash, side air bags. I feel the seats are too small and too firm, the engineers should be required to test drive for at least a 300 mile trip and that would insure better and more comfortable seats. The engine is noisy going through gears while accelerating but at highway speeds I do not hear it. The trade off for the fuel economy is well worth it. Buy the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 1st new car, third car I've owned in my lifetime. I love this car. I bought it right when the midwest snow storms started and it handles very well. The stabilization system has come in handy and my ABS is wonderful. The V6 option gives the car a smooth ride. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hot/cold cupholder, the aux jack for my Ipod, the sound system, and the remote starter! I also like the rear view mirror glare reducer. It comes in handy during the evening. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I used to own an Eagle vision, so it's nice to see the little things Chrysler has fixed in the last decade. I have a Touring with 2.7 V6, Boston speakers (NICE!), U-Connect (VERY NICE!), and power sunroof. The car gets some stares because it's new. I'm still under 500 mi, so no hi-revving for me. Taking my first trip (900 mi round-trip) this weekend to see how it handles on the highway. So far, so good. Got 350 mi on my first tank of gas in the city. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling - love it or hate it, like the 4-door Crossfire look. Love the 18" wheels. Driver's seat is comfortable. Plenty of headroom. New warranty options were refreshing. U-Connect is nice. Boston speaker option is nice too. All I need is a sub. Service knobs easy to reach under hood. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm a proud FORD owner, however my family works at JEEP and I get the EC discount. I leased my Sebring for 159 a month and the 2006 model is VERY boring. This 2007 model grabs from the 300C and the Crossfire. Its very affordable. The people that don't like this car because they want BMW or AUDI style and performance and want to pay like a KIA. Seriously give this car a try, this comes from a FORD person. FYI go for the V6 its much better!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior. the gauges, auto stick very fun to drive the cup warmer and cooler is a great feature. Auto climate control. The exterior looks like the cross fire. I would add a spoiler. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving a van for the past 7 years it was nice to go back to a sedan. We love the look. It is sporty and the front seat sits higher than most sedans. For being a small sedan it gives the driver and passenger plenty of room. I am really pleased with the overall performance of the car. It doesn't feel like the 4 cylinder engines I was used to. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the look, lots of room in the back seat. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The engineers at Chrysler should have taken a little more time in over hauling this car. More thought could have made this car more elegant. The interior could have been made a little less retro disco era and they could have give us more leg room and more comfortable seats. The 2.7 engine has no get up and go. They could have easily had to options the 4 cylinder or the other 6 cylidar, the 2.7 is not necessary. Also the moon roof could have been a little bit bigger. Being that the 300 M & Concords were eliminated, they really could have done better with the quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage on a recent trip to Boston I got 29 MPG! Sirus satellite radio, heated seats, slated hood </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's love at first sight with this car. The exterior design is sleek,smooth,and seductive. The '07 Sebring is right at home riding along side any other luxury sedan that you may encounter while riding around town. Once my wife and I sat inside the car we found it to be comfortable for our size(I'm 6'3/225) and it still leaves room for our girls in the back .Easy to read instrument panel and easy to reach dash controls. Driver seat manual controls for the base model are adequate,and the 2.4L engine rates about a seven getting on the interstate. The steering is tight and moves when you move and the gas mileage is excellent.I would recommend anyone to take the sebring out on a date and enjoy the day</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The entire exterior design,it is a eye catcher. The grill smiles at you.The raked hood puts you in the mind of the Crossfire. The cut on the side windows reflect the Chrysler 300 side windows.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car 3 weeks ago and absolutely hate it. It's the worse piece of crap I have ever rode/drove.The seats are cheap and very uncomfortable, and there is little if no leg room or hip room. If you are over 5 5 forget you have no head room. I feel very confined sitting in this car.The dash is made of this nasty cheap plastic with a silver tin accent and looks like hell.The moon roof is not very big compared to my other car and even thou I have the 2.7 v6 engine it is still sluggish. The head rest in the front seats are at an awkward angle so that you feel like your head is constantly being pushed forward. Its gas mileage is very good. Chrysler should dump this and bring back the 300 M</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Satellite Radio, gas mileage</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This a fun car to drive. It handles very well and the 2.4 has plenty of power for those of us who are looking for reliable transportation at an affordable price. It is easy to parallel park which is great for my wife. Even the low end model includes many features I paid extra for in our previous car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car sits higher than our Concorde did. This makes it easier to get in an out of for us older folks. The analog clock is a favorite feature. The temperature controls are within easy reach and are simple to use.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was a proud owner of the 1999 Chrysler Sebring LXi. I truly enjoyed driving that one until I went in to the dealership for service and the new 2007 model was staring at me. It called me over for a test drive and forced me to buy it. I love it! It drives like a sporty car but has the feel of a small luxury car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's hard to determine what the best feature is because there are so many but I would have to say.... The Hood. It has the hood like the sporty Crossfire has.</FAVORITE>
