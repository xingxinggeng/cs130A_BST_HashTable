<TEXT>I really love my Acura TL-Type S. The fit and finish of this car is really nice. Every time I walk out and get into the car I look forward to turning the ignition key. It drives very well on the open road and the freeway. We took a 6K+ trip this summer and the car turned out to really be a great touring sedan. I think it is the best looking car on the road on the outside. I find the seats comfortable. Braking is superb. Overall I think it is one of the best designs ever. If you can pick up a used one, what a great value it will be.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Strong pulling power when passing on two lane road. Comfortable seats and very nice leather. Navigation system screen placement is awesome. Best looking car on the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd TL - love the style. Also have a 2003 G35 which I'm thinking of trading but in no way will I buy the new 2009 TL. It's become one of the ugliest new vehicles on the road (also heavier & bloated). I think acura's 25 year old 2009 vehicle designer needs some design school mentoring. Also the new ZDX not only has the ugly front but it also has an "asteck" type rear. 5 of my professional colleagues who now have Acura's will not come back to the new - gen. quirky styles. Too bad; it's really a good engineered vehicle; but then so are many of it's competitors. The G37 stats will blow out the new TL stats - and it's not UGLY. Disappointed in Acura.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the exterior (European type) design. Interior is great as well. It's well proportioned in its design / details.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I cross shopped all the others in this class (Lexus, Infiniti, even BMW and Mercedes) I couldn't get anywhere close to the options for the money. This car comes loaded for less. The build quality is great, the engineering in this vehicle is superb. They thought of everything. Every surface has a pleasant texture, the switches and knobs operate perfectly with weighted balance. The Navi is a must, it transforms the experience in the car. Others just have a moving map of sorts, this becomes the control center for the car. Audio, climate, everything. You can use conventional buttons, touch screen or voice commands. Handles and drives well for a larger car. Very sharp design inside and out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I enjoy the touch screen navi and voice activation of just about everything. Lots of little things, like the way the doors are hinged, they will close by themselves once you get the hang of it. Very slick design. Window/roof control from the(switchblade) keyfob. ELS is the best I have heard in a car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This has been the best car overall that I have driven. It looks good, is screaming fast (faster than similar Lexus, BMW, and Infiniti I've driven). BMW 330xi was a close second to purchase, but a little plain on the interior and definitely overpriced. No problem with rattles except center speaker, and only on extremely rough roads (read eastern Washington's I-90). The sound of exhaust sealed deal for me. Sweet music to the ears. I often turn off the amazing DVD-A surround just to listen to the car. Beautiful. I have yet to find a smoother V6. Great looks. Solid build. Well thought out. No problems at all. Brakes are fantastic. Kids get creamy leather dirty, but cleans up nicely.</TEXT>

<TEXT>40k miles and no problems except for battery dying, but Acura replaced it free. This car runs as well as it did when it was brand new. I'm reading a lot of posts complaining about squeaks/rattles but on mine, it's minimal. Since buying this car, I did drive a friend's G35 which definitely has better acceleration off the line. However, the interior trim and lower cost of the TL still makes it the right choice in my book. One negative think I agree with is the ipod connector. I honestly didn't even know it existed until reading these posts because it's in such obscure location. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car just puts everything at your finger tips (except ipod jack) and you feel safe/secure. The fuel economy is up to 25 average, which is outstanding.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Oh, our beloved TL. Your misgivings are few, but substantial. We've owned the car for 28mos/24k now. Designed and destined for success in a "North America-Only" market, I feel it's a moderate success. Unlike some competitors, the cup holders really work; The seats and driving position are magnificent for those of larger proportions; The stereo is phenomenal; Fuel economy is above average; the 'value' equation is substantial. The shortfalls, however, drive us insane. The 45-series tires seem to have temper tantrums with the suspension tuning. The steering is incredibly vague and twitchy off-center. The transmission is clunky and crude. Low-end power is absent. Wouldn't buy another.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For a luxury car, the TL performs well, but is under-powered compared to others in the same class like the Infiniti G35 and the BMW 3 series. The suspension and handling is impressive at the expense of a smooth ride and a very poor turning radius. The 07 automatic transmission is less responsive than what I would expect from a luxury car Trim and paint quality is no better than the paint used on Honda cars while paint on the Infiniti is better. Road noise and rattles are the biggest issues with this model and Acura and Honda in general. There are known rattles in the 2007 TL many coming from the window sills front and back. Most do not happen all the time thus hard to trouble shoot</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Acura, but been having things go wrong; Navigation has been replaced once already, and now is still freezing up. Dealer says not sure what problem is. A lot of rattles inside cabin, Engine panels are being scratched by hood, along with the strut hood support. Plastic caps on door, and door panels rattle loose, plastic covering comes off on door pockets. Front grill piece of Acura logo, starting to rust. Why did they put a tape cassette player in it? Plugging in i-POD cable a joke and hard to operate when wire is snaked through arm rest. Why put heated seat buttons near cup holder? Coin collector keeper comes loose all the time when arm rest lifts up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has done what I thought was impossible. It's taken the fun out of driving. Outward visibility is useless. It's like living/driving in a cave. The all-back interior is hearse-like and depressing. The transmission is wonky. It has an impossible-to-read mind of its own. The suspension. Don't get me started. It can't decide whether it's a sports car or a sedan. The gas mileage is horrible. Sitting at idle in heavy traffic, you can watch the needle on the gas gauge slip down, down, down. The HVAC controls are confusing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased an '07 TL after owning 2 accords. Notable step up. Fit and finish is superb. Comfort is fine for a 6 footer. Performance is generally very good. Low speed torque / gearing can sometimes be annoying. Brakes are as smooth and quiet as any I've experienced. It does not handle like a race car, but it is not a race car. For its purpose and market, handling is fun and responsive. Mechanics and reliability after 22,000 miles is perfect. I do not share other writers' experiences with rattles. This car is well insulated. Not the first rattle in my experience. BTW, the sound system is great, but I do agree that the ipod jack is poorly located.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is amazing especially considering the price. We looked at the IS 350 and the G35S, The TL Type S has more bang for the buck. It comes fully loaded with touches like a back up camera. We?ve had our TL for 3 weeks and have put 1000 miles on it. The fuel mileage did improve after the break in period, and is now averaging 22 mpg. This car is not only fast but very entertaining. If you?re a techno geek, this car is for you. It has so many features it comes with 3 manuals. I?m still learning the Nav system. Steering wheel controls for climate, radio, blue tooth phone and voice-activated Nav are great and add to safety. I find myself using two hands on the wheel more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>F1 paddle shifters are great! Nav system with real time traffic is a must for us LA drivers. Interior design is ergonomic and very comfortable. This car makes you want to take a long drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you believe an ultimate driving experience is more than just rubber on the road, then the TL Type S is sure to please. My daily commute is approximately 95% freeway in Northeast Ohio. I don't slalom or corner hard so the rear wheel drive experience is lost on me. The TL does exhibit torque steer but that is really only noticeable when using the "Manual Mode" and accelerating hard. I was surprised to experience torque steer shifting into 2nd, but with 286 HP, I should have guessed. This car is a dream to drive and the interior design, techno-features and build quality far out-delivers the BMW. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So I picked up my Type S about 12 hours before writing this review, boy it is one thing of beauty, I got the Blackhawk with the taupe interior, a thing of beauty, the paddle shifters are way better than shifting manually and they are very precise. I went from a 2005 Nissan 350z to this sweet ride and it was well worth it. I am getting used to the luxury of having a backup camera and the navigation is a joy. Even though I live in New York City, I don't plan on getting lost much any longer. Well overall I give it a 9.99 out of 10. Hope this helps, ps. go for the 2 tone interior, it looks cool too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I compared the Type S with 6 speed manual to BMW 335 and Audi A4. The TL is much more roomy inside, especially the rear seat foot/legroom (TL more like BMW 5 series for interior room). I bought red exterior with lighter interior - was gonna get black interior but decided too dark. TL has highest crash test safety ratings, highest Consumer Reports score for its class (entry level luxury). The navigation system is excellent and easy to use. The clutch is perfect and the shifter snick-snickety smooth - real nice! The motor sounds awesome - like a turbo almost, and car is fast! Car is a real pleasure to drive. Audio system is excellent. Good value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Motor, clutch and shifter, navigation and audio system. Motor really kicks in at 5000 rpm. Center pass-thru (wish rear seats would fold down), interior roominess, good storage areas, 12V outlet in dash, body style and overall quality inside and out, Tire pressure monitor system real handy too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had mine for about three weeks now and had an accident on the passenger side. The airbags worked perfectly. Only the ones that should have deployed actually did. The other car hit me fairly hard and the doors protected the passenger side appropriately. VERY FUN TO DRIVE. Reminds me very much of the older BMW 540, lots of torque and tons of horsepower. The only real difference I can see is that it's made better, has more features, and costs an awful lot less. It's also a lot better looking than the new Bangle bimmers. The technology in this car is unsurpassed. Maybe a $90+K Mercedes has it beat, but I didn't pay $90k did I. :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is rock solid, beautifully designed, and perfectly executed. The exterior is conservative but aggressive. The tech is so far beyond anything else in the price segment. The engine sounds wonderful and performs equally well. Sorta along the same lines the Navigation is fantastic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is incredibly fun to drive. Engine is so sweet, transmission precise, awesome seats, technology galore, the red/white instrument panel is truly a thing of beauty, like a jet cockpit!! I had to replace two rear defective struts, and fix a rattle in the back, but other than that, I just love to drive this car. I looked at G35 and IS 350, and this one was the best (especially in rear leg room). And has the best combination of options for less money. I drive my Type S just to drive it sometimes, drive around town just for the enjoyment. And I love how it looks, and all interior features. Nice NICE car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great engine, HP baby!! interior is great. Red/white instrument panel is beautiful. Navigation so easy to use it. I get "Nice Car" everywhere I go. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I tend to keep vehicles for 10+ years, and previously owned a 1998 Honda Accord 4cyl which I had clocked 190K+ miles and was looking to upgrade. After looking at the 2007 Accord 6cyl, I was attracted to the body style and features of the Acura TL. The negotiated price was close to that of the Honda fully loaded. Since I adore the reliability of the Honda engine and drive train, I decided to give the Acura a closer look. I am not disappointed. The car is quiet, gets great gas mileage (I average 30-32 on the highway), and has power to spare when needed. The inside is comfortable, the ride solid but not too stiff. I love it. Turning radius & high octane gas are the only negatives; it's worth it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling looks almost European and is eye catching. The interior leather is beautiful, comforable, and adjustable to any like. The Nav system is great - it almost talks too much :- ). The blue tooth phone connection I use all the time. The moving passenger mirror and rear camera are great in rev.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fun to drive but does not go well in snow. Great looking interior and very comfortable. The Bluetooth is very inaccurate and extremely frustrating. Any noise in the car (i.e. fan or highway) throws off the voice activation of the Bluetooth. No dummy light for washer fluid. Cigarette lighter too close to the transmission stick. DVD stereo is nice but only DVD music works and there are very few of those and they won't work on regular CD players. Tire pressure indicator goes on in cold weather. I had planned to keep this three years, but I'm going to trade it in before hand. Even though I am a Honda fan, our Toyota Sienna handles the detail much better than my Acura TL. I won't buy another. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The interior is fantastic and is open enough to accommodate many body types & sizes. It's more of a luxury sedan then a performance sedan. The TL Type-S is basically the same as the TL except it adds a bigger engine with some added HP but it's still attached to a FWD vehicle, good for those who like the extra power. The interior design, fit and finish is excellent, the exterior is getting to be a bit outdated but it's still noticeable on the road. Comes with Honda reliability and it's fun to drive factor is high for a car that's not really designed to be fun to drive. Fuel economy is on par for a sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In my opinion, this car beats the G35 and IS 350 hands down. Everything is standard and you get the honda quality plus lowest TCO in its class. I've read people complaining about its fuel economy but that's bogus. I get 23 mpg average between city and hwy and I have fun with this car. If you want 30 mpg, then be willing to settle for less than 286 hp and slow down your driving. For the power this engine pumps out and the size of the vehicle, it gets great fuel economy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My silver 2007 called to me from the showroom floor. I was tempted by the Aura, but the lack of HID headlights and obvi was a deal breaker for me. Wonderful paint quality, interior and exterior design, and the new wheels make a great difference. This is my 4th Acura, 2 TLs an 2 MDXs and new models always correct issues I may have had with previous ones. Also, I've averaged 27 mpg in mixed driving over the first 2400 miles. But ride is stiffer than I expected, much stiffer than the Accord. Try it before you buy it, especially where roads suffer winter damage. And I also have the fuel light problem, although mine comes on after 13 gallons are gone from the 17 gallon tank - most annoying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a 2007 Acura TL-S in late January and I love it. I was choosing between the TL-S and the Lexus IS 350. Went with the TL-S because it was bigger and more roomy than the IS 350. The car has quite a bit of "get up and go" and will do 0-60 in under 6 sec. Handles very well. Interior is very nicely done and the car looks great from the outside. It is really the ideal blend of sportiness and luxury and comes loaded. I love the NAV system and the bluetooth is great! I love the seats too - very comfortable. Tip for those who do not like the TL-S wheels: I asked the dealer if he could trade out the TL-S wheels for the regular TL wheels and they were happy to do it for no extra charge. Try it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, NAV, iPod jack, leather interior, fit and finish, handling and performance. Luxury for an affordable price. You get a lot for the money... similar cars like the IS 350 cost $3-$4k more for the same features. Torque steer seems pretty well controlled.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had 2 Lexus GS 300s - very nice & reliable but BORING and overpriced. Had a 2004 Infiniti G35, loved it, but had a few quirks that the dealership couldn't get fixed. G35 got totalled and bought the Acura TL one week ago. I love this car, it comes w/everything, drives and feels better than the last cars I have had, even the Lexus. Love the Bluetooth. This car came with the extras that I had to pay extra for on the other cars. Couldn't have made a better decision and the price couldn't be beat.

<TEXT>It was time for me to to get rid of 2003 RSX type S that I've been driving for years. The 2007 TL type S not only filled the gap that I've been missing in the RSX-S, but surged my adrenaline beyond my expectation. Smooth and precise 6 speed manual gear box w/ limited-slip differential and 256 lb-ft of torque are the 2007 TL type S strongest points that clinched my decision to buy this car. I got to admit that I missed the scream from RSX-S between 3rd and 4th when VTEC kicked-in, but TL-S substitutes that w/ tourquey, high-pitched rumble exhaust modulation. Superb and very comfortable interior supports my decision to buy another 6 speed manual car, otherwise I'm going to fall asleep.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned 3 TLs and this one is a rattling piece of junk. I can't believe Acura's quality has gone in the toilet. Transmission is extremely loud and engine is already ticking. The TL is a great value for the money but at what cost. The ride is very stiff. I would hate to see what the new S rides like. The rattling interior will drive you nuts. I mean virtually everything in the interior rattles due to cheap plastic parts. If you travel and you are in the car for many hours a day, THIS IS NOT THE CAR TO BUY!! BEWARE!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolutely love my Acura TL Type-S. After test driving nearly every car in its class - BMW 330, Infinity G35 (2006), Mercedes C280, Lexus ES 350, etc.- this car stood out as the best option for me. It is comfortable, had solid performance, large back seat. My only 2 complaintsare that it gets just okay gas mileage, and the front end could be better styled. Overall love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd consecutive Acura (01CL, 04TL, 07TL S-type). i was not satisfied with the ride on the 04TL, and replaced the OEM tires with top line Bridgestones. ride improved dramatically. My 07 S-type has a harsh ride with the OEM tires. I realize it has a beefed suspension, but a tire change might be in order. Otherwise I am delighted with the new Acura TL S-type. It is an awesome vehicle in all respects.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car comes loaded with all features. Handles well and looks great. Best value for the $$. Other similarly stocked cars will run at least 1-2k more. I'm averaging about 24 mpg right now. I hope to see a little improvement after break in, but it's not that bad. If you like having all the "gadgets" in a car, you will likely be pleased with the TL type-S. The ride is pretty quiet, but you'll love cranking the dvd-audio disks anyway. True surround sound in the car is pretty cool. I fit my two kids in the back no problem. I wouldn't recommend more than two adults, you'll be tight. The type S comes with rims that in my opinion don't really work with all colors. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD Audio is amazing, wish there was more availability of artists. Bluetooth is great and navigation unit is pretty powerful and easy to use. Type-S has 286 hp, 0-60 right around 6 secs. I'm not racing anyone, so more than ample fun for me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought a black exterior with black interior base 2007 in December 06. I love everything about the car except the gas mileage is a little below what I expected, I drive about 70% street and 30% highway and I constantly get 20 MPG at best. Also, I wish the low fuel light would not be so premature. It usually turns on and I only have to fill up 14.5 or 15 gallons so there clearly has to be 2 or more gallons left in the tank. But other than those minor issues. I love the car. Its roomy and comfortable yet still has a very sporty drive and all the features seemed to be well planned out to make as easy as possible for the driver.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is flawless. One warning: there is a technological curve with setting up your phone and using the navigation. Lots to read. Second warning: not all cell phones can be used to import the cell phone address book from phone to car. I had to buy a new phone that would support all the features. It's minor but my relatively new Razor was not able to transfer its information. This is a great value. Compare it to BMW 3 series and see what you get for the money.

<TEXT>First, let me just say that I have been a staunch fan of the BMW 3 Series for years, but I have to say that they have lost me with the newest model, sedan and coupe. Specifically, the interior is low rent\ugly, and for $35K+ it shouldn't be. So, I test drove the TL and, wow, what a car! Granted, it's not quite the road handler that a 3 Series is, but it is just as good or better in every other respect. Build quality, check! Ride quality, check! Interior space\comfort, better! Acceleration, better! Value, much better! A similarly equipped 325i would have cost me $7,500 more. That's some serious dough! Bottom line; BMW lost me, but Acura found me!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving a 2006 TL for several months and purchasing a 2007 base model, here is my take on the differences. The 2007 is a little better overall. Its suspension absorbs bumps better than before while still maintaining its sportiness and handling. It's quieter on the highway and its seats are more comfortable (softer) - especially on longer rides. From the front, the separate fog lights, chrome-like strip along the bottom and integrated blikers in the side mirrors, give the car a more elegant look. The sporty body style, sporty handling and very comfortable ride made it a good choice for me. Notes: No squeaks or rattles, the new transmission is now derived from the RL's tranny.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth phone, DVD audio system, ride comfort, an MP3 jack, blinkers on side mirrors, day time running lights, excellent crash results, body style and interior design. P.S. The ride comfort reminds me of my base 2003 TL (which I traded in) but with much more sportiness, power and agility.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently traded my 06 Cadillac CTS in for the new 07 Acura TL Type S. I bought the Moroccan Red car with the upgraded 18" chrome acura wheels. I LOVE this color car with the chrome wheels. So, if you're unimpressed with the gray Type-S wheels you should check them out. The car handles well, has more get-up-and-go than my 04 GTO, and has optimal styling to boot. The back up camera is totally great for parking. The only negative I report is that it doesn't have the smoothest ride with the low profile tires. That is a mere negative compared to everything that it has to offer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Although it isn't the best car in any category, the 07 Type S does exceptionally well across the board - good acceleration, excellent interior and standard features, decent ride quality, etc. The most impressive part of the vehicle is its interior and the electronic gadgets that come with the car. The navigation is extremely easy to use, and I would have to say that only Lexus has a better nav system. However, I am finding that the fuel efficiency is quite a bit below what is advertised. As a side note, I test drove the 07 G35 AWD, 06 TL (A Spec and stock), IS350, and BMW 335. The Type S was a perfect blend of what I wanted at good price point (with the options included). </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my car for a couple weeks now and it is now my 3rd TL, first was an 02 Type-S then an 04 with ASpec and now an 07 Type-S. This car so far has handled nicely, the looks are improved with Quad exhaust and the additional safety features are great. So far MPG has been quite a bit lower... hope that improves with break-in. Performance is unbelievable, acceleration feels more than previous TLs and steering feels much sportier and exact. Interior fit-n-finish is awesome, backup camera nice addition, much quieter interior than any previous TL, almost too quiet. Nice exhaust note. And I'm thankful Acura went back to NON-INTEGRATED fog lights! The perfect sports sedan for the Midwest!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm not a fan of the wheels, but, like the color, they are nicer in person than pictures show. Torque steer is not an issue - I think Acura is limiting the torque on take-off. This could cut into 0-60 times though. Speaking of which, here are my guesses... 0-60 in 5.6. 1/4 mile in 14.3. The car pulls more once it gets moving. A later test with my g-timer will confirm these numbers. One thing of note is the sound system. It is AWESOME. Listen to the sample DVD that comes with the car and you will be sold. Fit and finish is nice. Handling is good but they put these junk Michelins tires on stock.</TEXT>

The ride is solid and the amenities are vast. I owned a Mercedes C320 and it doesn't come close to the goodies Acura provides. German makers tend to nickel and dime you over options packages that are standard on the TL. So far - Acura has a customer for life. The 2007 comes with a rear back up camera with the navigation package, side mirror turn signal markers, new 18 inch wheel design and retractable keyless entry fob.</TEXT>

When you own a sports sedan you should drive like it. The F1 shift option is great. With close to 300 ponies it flies. The Brembo brakes are a plus. The car turns on a dime and it's just a blast to drive. It's a 9.5 out of 10 in my book. Buy it and you will love it.

The 2007 Type S felt tighter around the corners and the acceleration was much quicker than my 2005 TL. As for the exterior of the car, I was very impressed on the changes that they made including the side mirrors, exhaust system, and the added fog lights. It looks very sharp! As for the interior, I love the ambient red lights in the Type S compared to the ambient blue lights. The Navi was upgraded and works to perfection and I especially like the MP3 hookup so I can connect my iPod. This is a "No Brainer" for all of the TL enthusiasts. I will be keeping this one!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously leased two Acura RLs; bought the TLS based on the quality build and driving experience of those previous Acura cars. Wise decision. Better than expected MPG to date--26.5 for 38M miles which includes balance of city/highway conditions. Treadwear remaining--40%. Never an alignment problem. Acceleration is outstanding. Car is quiet, comfortable, and feels solid. Pearl white exterior stands out in a crowd. Maintenance expenses to date: $367 (about $.01 per mile). How the car may be improved: (1) Larger vertical space for trunk opening, (2) Fold down rear seats, (3) Keyless ignition, and (4) More foot space for rear passengers. Even with these suggestions, this is one first-rate car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Acura (second TL - had an '04 before this), and sorry to say probably my last. My first two were great cars. This one, however, has had annoying problems. Most have been fixed by the dealership, but there is a noise coming from the brakes they have tried to fix 4 times and can't get it to go away for more than about 2 days at a time. We also have a 2008 Infiniti G35 and I am much happier with it, although I like the TL better on the highway; more comfort that sport.

<TEXT>Having happily owned Hondas (including Civics, Accords, Passports,CR-Vs and S2000s) since 1985, I really was eager to enter the luxury sport sedan market. What a treat this car has been. It moves like it's on rails, accelerates quickly, moves accurately, wherever you point it. On lengthy trips, my wife is able to nap, leaving me to enjoy the driving experience. No problems, no complaints with the exception of the premium gas requirement which I was aware of from the beginning. "If you're gonna' play, ya gotta' pay."</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy interior, instrument layout, XM radio (my wife bought it for me for Christmas), acceleration, body fit and finish. Soft leather upholstery reminds me of my recliner at home and it has daylight-like headlight illumination. The car looks like it's moving, even when parked. Get out the chocks!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always dreamed of getting an Acura ever since a friend of mine let me drive his. This car has such a great takeoff and is gorgeous! I do, however. hear rattling in the door. Sometimes it is hard to make a u-turn well. I love the navi, the surround sound, HF links. I am not aware of the gas light coming on because I try to fill up at half tank. I do wish that they would make it run with regular unleaded especially now with gas prices so high. All-in-all I think the 2007 Acura TL is the a blessing!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car and was dreaming about it for more than 4 years. Now that I have it, its so fun to drive it. Wish it gave better fuel economy but if you can pay for the car, you can pay for the gas. I wish it had just a little more power when I hit the gas. Its quick no doubt, but could be quicker from the get-go. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is more of a performance car than luxury. If you are looking for something that is quiet and very comfortable, you should go for the RL from Acura or BMW 5 series or any car in that range. The suspension on this car is more towards handling than comfort so it's a little tougher than what you expect from a luxury car. Don't get me wrong the car is brilliant, with the wide tires, it has a lot more grip, which increases stability and handling. Overall, a great performance car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Subtle sporty looks combined with a power-plant befitting Honda?s ?no boring drives? slogan. The manufacturer?s strong credentials and this car?s appeal made me give-up my beloved Accord EX V6 (1998, good low-profile tires). With the Type-S, I got a faster, safer and more luxurious car. Normal driving is smooth, but floor it and WOW! Which brings me to the torque steer issue: not a problem unless you want a race car. I put the VSA (vehicle stability assist) system of the Type-S through a real-life test on an icy parking lot this winter, and at 80km it kept the car on track by activating alternatively the rear brakes when I steered heavily in an attempt to get it to skid. Canadian-winter approved!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Aside from the nice appearance, this car has been a grave disappointment. I test drove the TL on a nice flat road. But in the real world, when I am accelerating over an uneven surface, the wobbliness of front wheel drive become painfully apparent, especially with 286HP. I have had persistent issues with cabin noise - there are constant creaks when going over bumpy roads - it makes the car sound cheap. I had a defective starter which needed replacement. The nav system is not very smart. The tranny had issues with the 3rd gear that needed fixing. Most importantly, the 3.5L engine is prone to pinging.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car for a year now, it's a huge step up from the Accord I was previously driving. It's a great deal, the competition costs thousands more for the same features. Gas mileage is great too, on a 500 mile road trip I averaged 34 MPG! This car isn't for everyone though. Those looking for the ultimate sports sedan (think BMW minded buyers) will say it's FWD and not sporty enough. Those wanting a cushy serene ride (think Lexus ES) will say it's too sporty and has too much road noise. You can't please everyone but for me this car is what I consider to be an ideal blend of everything. It doesn't excel at any one particular thing but does everything very well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine is great, not really torquey but once you get moving you'll hit redline very fast. I've timed 0-60 at about 7 seconds flat, a bit quicker if you shift yourself. The sound system is terrific, the cabin is spacious, HID headlights are great, won't drive a car with halogens ever again. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If God had created the perfect car, he would have created the Acura TL Type-S. This car is one serious piece of machinery. It is a triple threat; all the safety of a Honda, all the power of a sports car, and the design to kill for. It is the perfect culmination of attributes looked for in sport sedan. Also, this car gets incredible fuel economy for being a 3.5L V6. The 5th gear overdrive enables the TL to cruise at 75 mph only spinning a mere 2100 rpms; that's impressive by any standards. The average mileage at 75 mph with the AC cranked up and the lights and radio on is an incredible 35 mpg. This car is a hands down winner in all categories of sports sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving a number of sedans, I chose the TL over the Infiniti G35X. The TL is roomier and has a sporty ride with tight handling. (I loved the growling exhaust of the G35X but my wife thought it was too noisy. Oh well.) So far I haven't experienced any rattling and cabin noise which is a common complaint. I'm 6'3" and have trouble positioning the seat and steering wheel for optimal comfort. My hands and arms get sore on long trips. I'm clearly biased toward the Acura. This is the third Acura I've owned. I traded in a 1990 Legend. I hope to keep the '07 TL for many years as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has about as much fun as you do. It corners nimble and stays on line in the direction it is pointed.

<TEXT>With 12,000 miles on the TL: Good points - the car runs better now - improvements in both gas mileage (31 MPG straight highway trip) and a smoother shifting transmission (too much shift shock before). Bad points - the car developed various squeaks and rattles over the last 11 months - glovebox, center speaker, driver vent, instrument cluster, etc. - most of them now fixed. The colder weather has brought an annoying driver's door & window rattle. The interior headliner (roof) was replaced twice due to its two layers separating. Also, knowing the Acura service department employees on a first name basis is getting old. I prefer just oil change visits like with my previous 2 Acuras.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 10 yrs and 145,000 mi I sold my 528 BMW for a TL. First things first IMO the BMW E39 is superior to the TL in all dynamic driving categories period. But having said that the TL is still a very fine car. Reasonably quick, stylish, comfortable, quiet (no rattles here) and good gas mileage (got almost 31 mpg on our last trip). But the TL does have issues. First is the transmission, under normal everyday driving it's flawless but try some spirited driving and it's slow to kick down and the computer gets confused hunting for the right gear. Second is the suspension, it's jittery and on less than smooth roads the front will bounce, this is not a good thing, especially in a 'sports sedan'.</TEXT>

<TEXT>10,000 miles into my silver TL Type-S with 6 speed manual, and I figure I would give you all a follow-up. First, the bad: rattles in the door and steering column. Tsk, tsk in a near 40-grand sports sedan. Interior materials scratch real easily, and dashboard is starting to lose its color really quickly (from dark gray to milky gray). Torque-steer is getting old now. The good: this thing should be called a muscle-sedan instead of a sports sedan, because that's the demeanor it has. Big, mean looking, mean sounding, and fast. Handling is second only to BMW. Interior is very comfortable, and very spacious. </TEXT>

The new Type S has unbelieveable power and acceleration and handles like a nimble sport car. All in all a very exciting and sporty ride. The sporty suspension does make the ride a little harsh.

The thing I really liked best was that the things I really wanted (multi-CD changer, moonroof, leather) all come standard with the TL. I have had the car now for 3 months and I am really enjoying driving it. Although not as much horsepower as the S-Type, it is the most powerful car I have owned. I'm surprised I have not been pulled over yet. This is the first car I have owned that I have hit 100+ MPH with! I love the interior of the car with the black leather pretty much throughout.

<TEXT>I had been driving a Volvo S60 and had nothing but problems with it and was debating between TL and BMW 328. My buddy went with BMW and I went with TL. I made the right choice. Although it does not handle quite as sporty as the BMW, it will go when you need it to go. The everything standard interior is where it blows away the competition (especially the BMW). Compare standard package on a TL and then add them as options to everything else in its class and money makes it an easy decision. It is roomy, the sound system is great, and all controls are very easy to use. If this is the way Acura makes all its cars, I will be loyal for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned previous Acura TLs (2) and was very happy to see Honda bring back the Type-S this year. The impressive thing about this car is the level of features added from older versions. The fact that there are no options needed or available tells it all. The only thing I added was the iPod connection. The car's handling and performance is what makes it fun to drive. They didn't just add the RL engine, they did a great job tuning the suspension to really use the additional HP. This is probably the best buy out there right now when you consider all of the standard features, the fun to drive quotient, and the price you pay. Kudos to Acura.</TEXT>

The car has a lot of features and the switches and controls seem to be all in the right places except for the MP3 plug which is inside the armrest console, making it awkward to control. Nice sound system and easy to use navi system. Heard about rattling problem with hondas/acuras but haven't noticed it - lucky for a nice stereo system so i'll just crank it up!! The low fuel warning is a bit annoying since it comes on with 4 gallons to go. Overall though, I'm pretty happy with the car so far!</TEXT>

Too much rattling. I had a rattling sound coming from behind steering wheel and even the dealer couldn't figure it out. More rattle from the middle by cup holder. If the windows are down, they rattle as if some screws are loose in the door panel. I am seriously thinking about trading it in.

While not as solid in handling and performance as the BMW, the Acura TL-S has more creature comforts and almost as good handling for a lot less money than the BMW. The Lexus was great but not very solid at handling as the Acura TL. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has all the luxury features that are in similar offerings like Lexus, MB, Cadillac, et.al., but also has performance to go with it. Yes, you can purchase a Bimmer, but would you get all the standard features of this vehicle for the same price?? No. Just returned from a 800 miles road trip, and the car returned 31 miles per gallon. Excellent for a brand new car, usually it takes time for the engine to break in and get the advertised figures on the window sticker.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything standard. Xenon headlights are really bright.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For those who want amazing practicality of a midsize, outstanding lux, room like a fully equipped M35X and very great performance, look no further. For driving dynamics I am pro Infiniti. I drove the TL type S and compared to the G, the type S has less throttle sensitivity but it's more technologically sound, spacious and refined. 0-60 is about 6 sec flat, and w/fwd you can drive in the snow w/o too much fuss. It comes standard fully equipped, handling and composure is great while keeping cabin quiet. Some say the ride and torque steer is rough, but I not experienced such a thing in this vehicle. Save yourself 15'000 and get a type s, it feels like it should be worth 55K.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exhaust note is amazing, technological features are way ahead of their time no other compettiters come close, 2 tone leather perforated seats, Carbon Bronze color, smooth yet very brute force performance, 8" hi res screen the largest in any segment! Backup camera and pedals are amazing. Quiet cabin.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the car; if your'e looking for a quiet ride, this is not the car for you. Interior is poorly built, and there is much rattling. Outside driver's mirror bangs on something, center speaker rattles over bumps, dashboard (made of plastic) rattles over bumps, passenger's headrest makes a sound like someone is chewing gum in your ear. Also, if you test drive the car, leave the window open and keep your ears keen to the metal banging that happens underneath the car when hitting bumps at over 30mph. My car suffers from this and the 2 TL loaners that i've received so far also did this. Annoying, but I was told it's normal and not much can be done about it. Performance, design all good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were looking for a new car for my wife's commute and our weekends, something suitable for Wisconsin winters but attractive and sporty. No more minivans or SUVs - been doing that for years with kids. Came down to the BMW 328xi and the Acura, ultimately we decided to go with a fully loaded Acura for less money vs. a very basic BMW with no leather, power/heated seats, etc. We get lots of looks on the road - no Acura dealer for 100 miles, so it's also unique here. So far she loves it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 05 TL 5AT for 07 Type-S and I absolutely love it. I test drove the IS 350 but I didn't like the riding quality, space was too small, and also it didn't have option for manual transmission. Type-S was exactly what I want it. I was going about 40 mph and upshifted to 6th gear to see if this car could handle a stiff hill without stalling, and it did! It accelerated and gained more rpms as it was reaching to the top. With $4000 more than base TL, you get all the options: NAVI, brembo breaks, 3.5L engine, sport tuned suspension, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like the looks of the car and the nav features are great. The transmission is clunky (especially downshifting into 1st gear) and I was hoping that it would "break in" more. The seat is not as comfortable as my Volvo S60 but good leg and head room. Solidly constructed - brakes and handles well. Like the safety features. Nice car but will most likely go Infiniti or Lexus next time for the added comforts. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned an 04 TL, and an 05 RL. I traded that RL on a G35 coupe. Loved the G35, but really missed the Acura product. So, this past June 25th I walked into an Acura dealership and negotiated a deal on a 07 TL type S. A lot of the bells and whistles of the RL, faster and more stable than the TL. How can you go wrong. Not as fast as the G35, but so much more refined, and a pleasure to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is Acura number 4 for me. These car are incredibly reliable and great to own. The TL comes with virtually every option that all of the competition puts into pricey packages. I put in a lot of miles every year and comfort is a priority. The TL is extremely driver/passenger friendly. The ride is smooth and the shifting is seamless. Navigation and voice activated system is very good. No more fumbling for phone or headset since everything is hands-free and controlled from steering wheel. Design is pretty conservative but not bad. Mileage is better than last TL even with more horsepower. Currently I get about 28 mpg hwy and 25 overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>To start off, I owned a 2003 Type S as well. I drove the car to 100,000 miles with only 1 problem (a broken axle). I loved the car but sold due to the higher mileage and purchased a 2003 Audi A4 6cyl 3.0 engine. I never liked it and kept only 5 months. I test drove the G35x, IS 350, BMW 3 series, and FX35 Infiniti and chose the Type S again. This car is very fast and fun to drive. The handling is great but the ride is just OK, but I guess if you don't want that type of ride buy the regular TL (still happy). Really no complaints but I do only get about 19 MPG. I guess that's not too bad considering how impossible it is to not drive like a complete maniac. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Voice command - as long as the windows are not opened it works almost flawlessly. I never get errors in phone numbers like a few other reviewers posted. Nav is great. Brembo brakes are much better than on the 03 Type S. everything is located in the right place unlike other cars I test drove.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously owned an '05 TL and told the dealer I'd buy a new one when they dropped the RL's engine in it. Got a call, went down and test drove the TL-S. Loved it from the beginning. The suspension with the standard tires is much more compliant but still has enough firmess for great handling. My '05's suspension used to crash over road imperfections and was stiff. I found the TL-S to be much more refined with plenty of HP/torque with little torque steer. I looked at Infiniti's M45 and at BMW's 5 series; both are overpriced compared to the features on the TL-S. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the TL-S for a week now and I love it. I'm sure a sports car purist would find plenty to gripe about, but it's NOT a sports car, it's a sporty sedan. And as a sporty sedan the TL-S excels. The engine is excellent with lots of low end torque and a wide power band. Handling is crisp but will not rattle your teeth loose. The interior is very well laid out, quiet and comfortable. All in all, it's as near perfect as a car can get.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation system is neat and seems to pick the best routes. The stereo is also very good and I love that it plays MP3s from CD or DVD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great buy for an entry-level luxury car. It has great HP, easy steering, and looks great. I opted for the 19" Acura chrome wheels and chose the red exterior for a more feminine look. It has been called a "sexy" car by many who have seen it and I must agree. However, I think the carbon grey or the black is very handsome! You will love the sound of the exhaust and find yourself wondering if there's a V-8 in there. Also, no more second guessing your reverse-parking skills due to the fancy back up camera. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the back up camera! This alone would prompt me to buy this car again! I also like the navigation display that changes with day/night, and the XM radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>1,500 miles and only one problem. Rear deck was vibrating from the subwoofer. They took out the back seat and sprayed some foam back there. Problem solved! I researched for seven months prior to purchasing. The Acura TL-S blows the doors off anything out there in its class: BMW, Audi, Infiniti, etc. The technology in it is amazing and not a la carte like all the other MFGs out there. Gas mileage is a bit disappointing - I am avg around 20 MPG. But blazing acceleration! 286 HP baby! Car is a real headturner! Quad exhaust really sets it apart with the deep exhaust tone. People stop me all the time to check it out. Not many on the road which is a plus! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 2005 MDX and recently we needed a second car. After test driving three different Acura models, I chose the TL. The car was far superior to the TSX (in quality as well), and also had a more sleek and mature personality than the RDX. Since we have an MDX, I opted for a nicer, smoother and more sophisticated TL. I chose the S-series to get the manual transmission - lots of fun. The car is subtlely aggressive, yet practical too. My kids fit easily and safely, and the gas mileage is AOK (25 mpg mixed (city/hwy)). Love my Acura(s)!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav, DVD audio, voice control, two-tone leather, interior lighting, power, handling, audio system, comfort, fun factor. One touch button moon roof. All instrument settings illuminate (RED) - not so on the 2005 MDX. Thanks Acura! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Went from a 2004 BMW 330i 6M to the new TL Type-S 6M, and I love it! Also tested the G35s 6M, 335i and 328i, A4 2.0T Quattro and Lexus IS 350. I was leery about the FWD with 289 horses mated to it, but torque steer is minimal (and kind of fun), and it does not detract from performance. This car is more responsive and precise than the BMW was when it came to handing. The interior is much more spacious, comfortable, and user-friendly. Glad I made the decision on the Acura! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smoooth V6 with an oh-so-sweet exhaust note. Slick shifting 6 speed with easy to operate clutch. Steering and cornering is as precise as it gets. Build quality inside and out. User friendly radio, HVAC, NAV, and bluetooth. Loaded for under $40K and everything comes standard. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First and foremost, I have to say this car turns heads like no other I've driven. It looks good and sounds even better. I've had the car for less than 2 weeks and can't stop finding reasons to go outside and drive it. The quad exhaust has this deep thundering hum when dropping from 3rd to 2nd. On the flip side of this, with the windows closed on the highway, it's like sitting in a serene park. You almost want to turn down the stereo just so you can here the pindrop silence. The back up camera is all you need to reverse and the auto flip mirrors are just an added bonus. This car has so many features that I don't even know where to start. Love the car and hands down would've bought this again</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a German I've driven BMW, Mercedes and Audis. When I was looking for a sports sedan again I felt I get a lot of value for my $ with this Acura TL-S. I had it for about 1 month now and it fits like a glove, drives smooth, put the pedal to the metal and it will push you in the drivers seat. Very roomy and excellent design. Plus Honda's long reliability seems to surpass BMW and Mercedes. Also if repairs are needed Honda / Acura is cheaper than BMW. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this vehicle for about a week now. It came w/ the technology package. The ride is rather sporty and bumpy a bit (comparing it to my wife's Lexus ES 300) but enjoyable. In the looks department, it gets 2 thumbs up and since I haven't yet broken it in, I can talk about performance just yet. Everything is voice controlled which makes a great conversation piece but voice control and command is too buggy. With the windows up, no fan running and no one else in the car, I can not get the bluetooth to record the numbers correctly. I have tried over and over and it seems as for certain numbers, time after time, throws some extra digits in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a beautiful car, loaded with everything you'll ever need... and it's FAST, really fast. Its exhaust note sounds awesome and it is comfortable beyond compare. The 6-speed gear box is indescribably crisp and precise. For the std equipment level, you'd have to pay >$7K more on a BMW 328xi, my second choice. Make no mistake, the sport sedan purists and cognescenti scoff at anything other than a rear-drive set up. That said, the torque steer is WELL managed and barely perceptible. The reliability of Acura & Honda is well-known and the technology present will keep me busy for years to come. This is the baddest car for money!!</TEXT>

While the G35 and IS 350 are quicker, and the 330i's handling dynamics are superior, no other car balances performance, technology, comfort, and value better than the TL. Plus, all of these cars cost quite a bit more comparably equipped.</TEXT>

That is, until I spoke with a few friends, and they suggested that I check out the Acura TL. So, I did.

<TEXT>I recently was in the market for a new vehicle. I looked at everything from the '07 Mercedes C350 Sport Sedan, to the BMW 5 Series, and the Lexus IS 350. I drove all of the vehicles. But, it only took one drive of the TL Type-S to realize the value for the price. I wanted daytime running light, side airbags, great sound system, alarm, good crash ratings, and navigation. All of my requested items were already standard on the '07 Acura TL Type-S.</TEXT>
