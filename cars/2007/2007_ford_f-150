<TEXT>Bought this truck used with 30,000 miles and am now at 47,000 within 8 months of owning it. So far,not one thing has broke, extremely reliable! And, i get better gas mileage than any v6 ranger owner i talk to. I was shopping for a Ranger when i bought this truck , and I'm sooo glad i did. It's a bit underpowered, but do you expect, its a v6.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reliability. Space behind seats. (was able to fit the 12" sub and box from my car there without modifying it!) And great gas mileage for a half ton truck (avg 19-21 mpg)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the truck with 2 miles on it in 2007. Don?t get me wrong I love my truck and I have had 2 F-150 before this one but it had been in the shop 5 times since I have had it. The first time it was a window gasket. It has had two starters and now it is in the shop getting a new flywheel. It only has 30, *** miles on it. Even after all this stuff?. I still love it and would not trade it for anything else. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Extra storage behind the seat and the tailgate assist. And it has a big FORD emblem.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love this truck, its the best truck we have ever owned... Bought it with 2 miles on it and have loved every mile we have put on it.. With the exception of when it was in every ford dealer in the state of Arkansas for the a/c squeal... The one that we were told was "Normal" by all the ford people.. I dont see an a/c screaming when its on to be normal.. and a body plug fell out Odd I think but overall its been a great truck! Especially when you spray liquid wrench on the compressor to make it stop squealing!!!</TEXT>

No problem in the 3 feet of snow that fell in one day the first year we owned it, have never had to put extra weight in the back. I'm not a truck person but this truck is AWESOME and fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 6th F150 Supercrew. 5.4 v8, 3.73 limited slip rearend, chrome package, Dark shadow gray/silver on bottom, skid plates and few other goodies. Current mileage 17K. This is a great truck. I've had an entire pallet of ceramic tile(3000LBS)in the bed of this truck and the only noticeable difference was the truck sat level instead of nose down. Average 12-13mpg city and 18.5-20mpg highway. Only one minor problem during a cold spell this winter the 4X4 acuator on the front axle wouldn't engage. Dealer found water in acuator and it had frozen. Dealer replaced it in a few hours I was back in the mud. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third f150. I have always liked them. I purchased this truck new and around 16000 miles I noticed a tapping noise from the engine. The dealer said it was the fuel injectors. I've never heard noisy fuel injectors before. So when winter arrived and I started the truck the noise was even louder than before, and when the accelerator is pressed the tapping became quicker. Dealer inspected, ran tests for a week and finally called in their Ford rep who advised me that it is a characteristic of the f150. The salesperson didn't advise me of this trait. I asked what characteristic could I expect in another year or two. Guess what! No answer!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th F150 Lariat since 2000 and probably the worst (Lariat Chrome edition). I've had it for 2 years now and its been in and out of the shop on many occasions for engine bogginess (5.4L), transmission problems (transmission has now been rebuilt), brake problems (2 brake jobs already), backup sensor problems (replaced 2 so far). My lease expires in less than a year. Thank God! I've had enough. I don't think I will be leasing another Ford truck again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 06 Chevy Silverado that was tricked out for my Ford. I wanted the bigger engine because mine was a 4.6. My neighbor talked me into to it. The interior of the Ford is overall sexier than Chevy. The FX2 edition comes with the body kit. Although I would have liked the Titan, Ford gave me more bang for my buck. For the price I paid for my FX2, I would have only gotten a base model Titan. I lost a little bit of towing, but I will never tow that much so in reality I bought a truck that even my wife isn't afraid to drive. Now, I just have to ask her can I drive my truck sometime.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my F150 Lariat for a year now. I am coming up on 15,000 miles and have had one very minor problem, a power window switch, it was fixed at no charge with no hassle. I read in many reviews, about a lack of power and a sluggish feeling. My F150 has the heavy duty suspension, limited slip, 3:73 gear ratio and really doesn't do too bad. It has a very smooth powertrain that delivers horsepower evenly through-out the RPM range. Under normal conditions you don't feel the acceleration, then all of a sudden you notice that your doing 80MPH! If I want to accelerate quickly I click off the over-drive and it gets right with it. I'm averaging 15-16 MPG, mixed hiway-city driving. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is awesome! I love the heated leather seats, the auto dimming mirrors and the stereo system. It sounds nice for a factory unit and cranks the tunes out at a decent volume level. I installed a set of wheel to wheel step bars for a customized look that allows easy access to the bed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the best truck I've ever owned. I've got 46k miles on it, and it drives like the day that I bought it. I don't know why people have all of these negative comments about gas mileage. People have to learn how to drive economically. It's all about driving style. I drive 90% interstate, and regularly get over 600 miles out of my 30 gallon tank. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this truck for my business. I use it all the time. I have driven it hard and not one time to the shop, no rattles no squeaks. This truck is awesome. I had a Toyota before this and had more squeaks and rattles in it than I care to mention, in the shop all the time. I will stick with American made all the way. This is the third in the fleet after the Toyota went bye bye. I now have a Ford, Dodge, and Silverado all trouble free. Good job. American made and that is all I will buy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this truck to pull my horse trailer - I love it! The outside styling is great, very sleek and sharp looking. Rides smooth and quiet all the time, and rides comfortable! I tried to work with GM on either a Sierra or Silverado and no dealership would work with me so I ended up w/ a Ford by default and I'm not sorry! I really like this truck! Fuel economy stinks compared to GM's that I've seen - I get about 13 MPG compared to almost 20 MPG on GM trucks that friends own. Inside storage is okay, although there is a small storage compartment under the radio and its useless - very shallow and everything falls out of it. Overall, I like this truck a lot and would buy another.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable to ride in, sharp body style, lightweight tailgate that is easy to put up and down, deeper bed that makes the truck look bigger. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I must admit- I was an "import" guy since I started driving 20 years ago. My last cars have been Infiniti and Lexus. But, I wanted a truck and shopped them all- Nissan, Toyota, Dodge, GM- and Ford got my business. It's been 6 months and this truck has been absolutely rock solid. This truck inspires confidence both on and off the road- and can haul anything without hesitation. Plus, it's a great highway vehicle- quiet and smooth. I got the FX2 sport, and I love the looks, cool- big stance, but not overdone (like the Tundra), classy, and purpose built. Now I know why Ford is the #1 truck in the USA- they earn it. I would definitely buy this truck again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck is a serious machine. I've driven GM trucks for decades. After being tired of replacing transmissions and large repair bills after 100,000 miles, I decided to give the Blue Egg boys a shot. his truck does not disappoint. I believe the GM might be slightly quicker in 0-60, but put a trailer on the back, and you'll appreciate the Ford's torque advantage. Guys - Quit wondering! Go get one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the greatest truck ever. It is so fun to drive. Just sitting in it with the sunroof, leather seats and all the chrome and Harley emblems makes me feel like I am on my Harley Davidson Roadking! The rumble of the stock exhaust just adds to the feeling! Handles great and runs good with the standard 5.4 engine. Everyone gives it a second look on the road. No complaints here. Fuel mileage is not great, but who cares when you feel good about your ride!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the truck itself, it's easily the nicest looking truck on the road. I've only had mine for three weeks, but it's going into the shop to be repainted because someone at the Dearborn plant didn't know how to paint. On three parts of the truck, there are paint flaws. Not just flaws, but actual debris in the paint, like little specks of sand were on the truck when it was painted. Because of this, this is the last Ford I buy. The consumer shouldn't have to be forced QA department. So, yeah -- awesome truck, awful fit and finish.Word to the wise: Do not buy a Ford made in Dearborn. And carefully inspect the vehicle in full sunlight before you do. Look it over and over again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's the price/performance ratio that got me. I wanted towing capacity and 4WD, and got such a great deal, I couldn't pass it up. Got tired of snooty foreign dealers who wouldn't deal. Thanks to them, I got an excellent truck - it rides great for a commute, or when I tow the boat. I don't need sportscar acceleration- it's a truck! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seating capacity is great. Actually, there's enough room for me to live in it. 4WD works easily.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>2007 Harley-Davidson with Steve Saleen dual screw, intercooled SuperCharger. This is my fourth F-Series truck, 1975 F-100, 01 F-150 Lariat Supercab, 05 F- 150 King Ranch 4x4 SuperCrew. What else can I say. 07 HD is a Beautiful truck, more power than you can imagine. The Harley-Davidson has the same engine as my 05, but gobs more of power with the SuperCharger option. Ford did it right. This is a great addition to the F-150 line.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow! The supercharger wakes this F-150 up. Passing power at the push of the pedal. This is my 4th F-series Ford. 1975 F-100 Long Bed, 2001 F-150 Lariat SuperCab, 2005 F-150 King Ranch SuperCrew, and now a 2007 Harley- Davidson SuperCharged SuperCrew. It is Black Beauty with more power than my 1994 Mustang Cobra Indy Pace Car. The Saleen supercharger provides some much more power and torque than my 2005 King Ranch with the same 5.4L engine. I'm really looking forward to driving this F-150 for a long long time. Ford has outdone itself. Fuel economy, premium fuel, if I was concerned with fuel economy, I certainly wouldn't have bought the Harley or the Mustang Cobra. A+ to Ford.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After being a die hard Chevy guy for so long I had a hard time looking at the F-150, but am very happy I did. I got the XLT and optioned for the 18 inch wheels and 5.4 L engine. Also got the skid plates, chrome package, CPT chairs and some other goodies. This truck looks so much better then the Chevy and price for value kills the other big trucks. I have read the power and gas mileage complaints. It tows great, and it is a 4x4, so I dont plan on racing anyone. As for mileage, its a big truck with a V-8....like my trucks before I did not expect 25-30 MPG. I am getting around 16 in town and can nurse 20 or so on highway with the cruise set at 80. Very comfortable, stylish and roomy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second F150 of the current design. My first was a base model regular cab '05. The first one was great, and this one has even more! I think the interior is very spacious and comfortable. It is stylish, and the cab is laid out well. The exterior is gorgeous... The best looking truck on the market, in my opinion! I have only put 700 miles on this one so far, but I have been impressed. Build quality overall is good, though I do have a bit of a rattle from the retractible cup holder. Also, there is a bit of an air intake wine or whistle during acceleration. I added a K&N intake to the 4.6L V8, and it sounds amazing! Improved the acceleration too! I highly recommend these trucks!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 4,200 miles on my Lariat and absolutley love it! It's very comfortable, handles well, looks great & performs very well. The heated leather seats, great stereo and all the other amenities of the Lariat are great! Shifting to 4 wheel drive is as easy as turning a knob and comes in handy on snowy roads. The 3:73 Limited Slip rearend may give it somewhat of an edge in the performance department. I test drove another Lariat that seemed very sluggish and my truck actually gets with it pretty well. I have no problem keeping up or leaving other trucks or cars behind when I get the urge. Gas mileage is fair at 15 - 16 MPG mixed city/hiway miles. I am enjoying this truck immensly!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Sirius radio coupled with the CD changer is great. The heated, leather seats are very nice as is the climate control and auto dimming mirrors. The gauge cluster is really nice also. It is remarkably smooth riding and quiet.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In the four months I have owned the vehicle, 34 days were spent with it in the shop. They are continuously replacing the air bags as the panels keep warping. (3 on drivers side, 2 on passenger side) The steering wheel was replaced as well as the exterior temperature sensor. The four wheel drive went out after about 5 minutes of using it. Gas mileage keeps getting worse and worse (down to 10.6 mpg) and to wrap up the experience, it has already had to be repainted as ford missed some spots and it started to peel. Not what I would expect for $38,000. Would never buy a Ford truck again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first truck- and first American purchase in 15 years. I originally had my heart set on a Tundra. My company fleet manager recommended Ford F150's for the reliability. I was skeptical but after test driving the Ford, I fell in love. (also test drove Dodge and Chevy) Great power and excellent handling! Yes, the Tundra and Chevy are more powerful and quicker "by the numbers", but the Ford just felt solid and sure-footed. 300hp is all I need around town. Nice big industrial-grade interior (I'm 6'3") designed for people my size. My kids love it too- it's like a big Tonka truck. I've got the 5.4l V8 FX2 Sport SuperCrew. Nice job, Ford-you brought me back to American made!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Industrial-grade design and build, FX2 design pkg, powerful V8, super-quiet interior, roomy inside, too. Handling and acceleration- still amazing that this is a truck. Super-size center arm-rest glove box is very handy. Outside door handles- yes, door handles- they feel sturdy and smooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased my 2nd F150. Told myself I wasn't going to buy another Ford truck again.I was tricked by the interior and exterior design and style of the truck, far superior to any of the others. My problem is with the way the truck shifts. The 4 speed auto feels lazy and sluggish when shifting. Also, the rear end clunks when the tranny downshifts when accelerating from a lower speed.(same as my 1999 F150). With the O/D off it doesnt make the noise?? I also can feel the windshield wiper vibrations through the brake and gas pedals. Very annoying. There is minor idle vibration as well. I would not have purchased this truck if I had noticed these issues during my lengthy 10 minute test drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great truck so far. Been driving it a week and am very impressed. This truck is definitely not built for speed, but it has so much torque. This is a "man's truck". Just by touching the gas, you will be up to hwy speed pretty quickly and never will never even see your RPM's go above 2300. I can just imagine the power when I start pulling my camper. Aside from the engine, the build and design of the truck is by far my personal favorite of all the trucks. It just looks American and built Ford tough!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Design, big 20" tires, 150" wheelbase, and it's very comfortable. Also very quiet when it idles, and is still quiet when you hit the gas; although, you hear the roar of the torque kick in. My leather CPT chairs make me feel like I'm riding in a Lincoln Town Car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 8th new Ford P/U in 11 years. From F-150s to F-350s. The last problem I had was with my 96 diesel. That was a faulty sensor. My new F-150 Lariat supercrew 4 by is fully loaded. The rear seat DVD player is a blast when the storms knock out the power in the house. The nav system and sirius radio with mp3 are fun, and fill the niches. The White sand tri-coat draws admiring looks and compliments from all circles. The interior looks and feels luxurious. My fuel economy is overall around 19mpg. The 35.7 gallon tank comes in handy for those cross state round trips. The audiophile system is a force to be reckoned with. It shames the youngsters into retreat. Try the after market LED light.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice truck but dealer told me I made a mistake buying 5.4 motor. Rough idle and vibration at approx 1750 rpm is normal for this truck according to my Ford Dealer. Hard to sit at a light and feel the seat vibrating due to the normally running 5.4 l motor at idle. Traded a great running chevrolet at 127000 miles that idled smoother. If Ford cannot resolve this (non- existent according to the dealer) problem...I will take a bath and go back to a chevrolet...never to buy a ford again</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second F-150, first one was an 04 FX4. Both have been great trucks. It's very responsive, does well off road and in sand..the shift on the fly comes in handy. Gas mileage has been around 13.4 city and 18.8 highway. No matter what trim level you get, you'll be happy. Definitley go for the 5.4 triton, the 4.6 was sluggish off the line. Overall two thumbs up</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third F150, and I love this truck. Last winter,(when the truck was brand new), was one of the roughest I can remember. This truck lives at 8000 ft. in the "foothills" of Colorado, and it has never let me down, I have 12K on it now without a single problem of any type. I can hold 70 mph going over the highest pass in this country while barely touching the pedal. Since it can do that at over 10,000ft. elevation, it has all the power I need. I run E85 exclusively. So far it's doing just as well as my other one which has 185K on it. I'd tell you about the reliability of that one but you'd think I was lying.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's very quiet, and tracks on the highway like a laser. You get great feedback through the steering wheel when driving through snow or on dirt roads.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After much research, I finally bought my Lariet. Granted I've only had it for two days, but I've got to tell you it is an impressive truck. I've read many reviews and some reviewers complain about a lack of power; this certainly is not evident to me and I'm used to a 2001 Mustang GT. It's power is consistant and smooth throughout the RPM range. Inside it is amazingly quiet; the style and comfort of this truck is down right awesome! So far, I love it! If it holds up like my 1984 Bronco II did, it'll prove to be one hell of a truck. Check back in 10 years for an update!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The quietness of the cab and the smoothness of the ride, even while braking. The engine performs as smoothly as the ride. The leather interior, a great sound system, heated seat and mirrors and all the other amenities are just icing on the cake. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Good all around truck for regular folks. The small V8 is sluggish at first but will move down the road very well. Works fine for what most people do. Rides like a truck, not a car. I like that. Get the bigger motor for more serious work. I can get 21mpg highway if I drive reasonably <70. Pulls a small boat well and has plenty of room and comfort. Sides of the truck are high and makes getting stuff in and out a bit tougher than with previous models.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned nothing but Nissan, Toyota, and Honda for the past 30 years, I never thought I would own an American built truck, but here I am in this new Lariat and I've got to say, I've been pretty impressed. Drove it from Wyoming to Arizona and it cruised beautifully, was quiet, and my bum and back never got tired of riding! Got 19 MPG, which I thought was phenomenal, considering the weight of this truck. So now I'm selling my Honda Ridgeline (which, don't get me wrong, is an awesome vehicle), but I live on a serious 4x4 road and I just feel a lot safer now in the Ford than in the Honda. I am duly impressed and lovin' it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just recently purchased the F150 FX2 with crew cab and the 6.5 ft truck bed, it's a beast! It drives like a luxury car but will pull 9500 lbs. Interior very comfortable, sirius radio is great, has premium sound system which sounds better than the Chevy Bose. Getting 16 mpg so far. Parking can be difficult with the size but you get used to it. I was comparing a Chevy ext cab to this and in the long run I have a bigger truck, Chevy doesn't offer a 6.5 ft bed with their crew cab. No complaints so far, mileage will improve once broken in and once I add a tonneau cover. Do yourself a favor and get the bigger truck, it's there if you need it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6.5 ft bed, nail the throttle and smile as the beast hits 5500 rpms and has no struggle passing, siirus radio, crew cab, 20" wheels sharp looking. MPG not bad for such a big truck, it's a truck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 07 Ford F150 is a very well built truck. This is my 3rd Ford truck. My first one came out of the oil fields and it took a lot of abuse. It had 167000 on it when I was done with it and was still running strong. I can tell you the 07 is built a lot better than that truck. So I have high expectations for it. This truck is not going to win any quarter miles, but it will pull, which is what you want in a truck. It is a heavy brute with the comfort of a luxury vehicle. I read the reviews on the 07 before I bought it. Some complained about acceleration. I did not think it was bad at all from taking off. It could use a little more at higher speeds, but trust me, the rest of the truck will out weigh this. If you want to race, buy the Mustang. Low end torque trumps.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is great and the body style is second to none. I could not believe how quiet it is inside. I have driven them all, Ford far surpasses the competition in this area. So far the 3 Fords I have had have remained quiet. Even the one with 167000 miles on it, not a squeak from the dash. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Acceleration was more than I expected from the 4.2 V6. With 202 horsepower and 3.55's it is plenty peppy. With 4800 miles on it mileage is around 17 city and 21 highway. Mileage should increase slightly at around the 15,000 mile mark when the engine is fully broken in. With the base sound system it produces a very nice note! I am very impressed with the truck! Comfortable, supportive seats, good ride quality, no wind noise at highway speeds, and the feel that your are in a well built quality vehicle tells me that I made a good purchase! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck is far and away the best overall value when it comes to full size pickup trucks. You get more towing capacity and interior volume than any other truck out there when comparing total statistics and capability vs. the price paid. Toyota and Nissan also build great trucks, but option them so heavily that it's impossible to get the same level of value. The only close comparison to this truck is the Chevrolet/GMC twin, and it lacks a bit in the towing and interior space department, as well as falling behind in the incentives category. Ford's F150 is reliable, handles well, gets decent mileage and is very comfortable. You cannot go wrong with this vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Ford SuperCrew I purchased has already had problems. The signal lights stopped working last month, and the windshield washer stopped working this month. There is also a heat sheild that has been fixed twice that is still fibrating in my ear. Over all the quality of the truck is poor. It is a nice truck to drive when it is working correctly, but it has not worked correctly in since it was new. I would like to trade it in but Ford plays with the pricing so much that it is hard to find what the real value is. They do not hold any value. I will take a $12,000-$15,000 loss on it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a new 2007 F150 Lariat, so I can't speak to long-term quality like some others might, but I have to say that it is much more than I expected. The brakes are awesome and what sold me on the truck as I looked for a tie-breaker between it and the 2008 Titan. The ride is very good and the cabin is so quite that it is hard to believe you are in a truck. The accessories are convenitently located and the appeal of the Lariat interior is super. The trim is complex and appealing. There's rich wood trim in combination with some modern metalic type finishes, as well as bright chrome. Seat support is good too. I was afraid I would miss my Lincoln but now wonder why I didn't do this sooner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Now that I own the 5.4 liter, FLEX FUEL VEHICLE, F-150 4x4, I am realizing a very poor "gasoline" fuel economy of about 10 MPG highway which is much less than the 18 MPG that was posted on the window sticker. E85 is much worse. The non-adjustable seat bottom revealed itself as a rear end problem after the first 200 miles. I am not sure what the engineers at Ford were thinking when an adjustable seat bottom was not added to the lower lines of pickups. I would have been happy with even a manual adjustment. I don't think that these problems are going to disappear as my wallet gets much thinner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ergonomics of the cab are well done as all controls are convenient and intuitive. The 4x4 shift on the fly is a great feature. The stereo is pleasurable due to the quiet ride of the vehicle. The 8 foot bed makes this more of a useful truck than the numerous passenger trucks on the road.</FAVORITE>

We will primarily using the truck for hauling large items and off-roading to get to quiet places in the mountains. If we were more interested in towing, the F-150 may not have been in play.

<TEXT>"Z" plan buyer (owned 15 Fords). Best luxury truck in class...but. Ford is so close to perfect but misses the mark on basic no brainer features and poor warranty. I'm convinced the engineers do not drive trucks and do models and CAD design for looks not function. Unfortunately, they could have a home run and turn around the company if they would listened to the public and get back to basics. Weak A/C and pitiful fuel economy. Front passengers have elbows in rear cupholders. Poor location. Most Ford dealerships try to scam general public and still try to con the A, X and Z plan buyers with over-inflated dealer adds further ruining Ford experience. </TEXT>
