<TEXT>It has almost been three years as we purchased this in 11/06, and this is our 5th Odyssey. We normally trade after 24 months but we felt we drive this one until the wheels fall off. Well we are at 104K and its still drives like a brick. Sure gas mileage could be better, but with all the conveniences that the van offers... If I wanted el cheapo I'd get a KIA... Yeah brakes shutter as the brakes get warped quick... well it is a 4000+lb tank!! I have NO regrets!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own a 2007 Odyssey with 20,000 miles on it which I purchased new. I've had two mechanical issues so far. The first was with a noisy power-steering unit. The noise was caused by a faulty power steering fluid reservoir which allowed air to get into the system. The second issue is with the transmission. It shutters at 20 & 40 mph under very light pedal applications. I had it to the dealer once so far without a fix. I believe it is an issue with the cylinder deactivation system. A friend had a similar issue and had their active engine mounts replaced. I may start there with the dealer on my next visit. Fuel economy is poor. Avg. 16/17 around town & 18 on vacation trip loaded down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Other than the mechanical issues mentioned above, the van is well designed and built. It is attractive inside and out, drives nice, and the engine is silky smooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned Hondas in the past and found them reliable, so I blindly chose the Odyssey when it was time for a minivan. Big mistake. This huge "mini" van drove like a bus, was difficult to park, and had problems the dealer was not able to fix. At 20K miles, the rotors warped, the front tires had to be replaced, and the front wheels were constantly out of balance. At 25K miles, the engine mounts failed, followed by the torque converter and the A/C. It vibrated all the time while driving and the dealer could do no more. Reading the reviews on this model year, I found I'm not the only one with these problems. I just traded it in on a Sienna and have never been happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We leased a 2004 and currently leasing again a 2007 Honda Odyssey. The 2004 Odyssey never gave us any mechanical or electrical troubles. So far, the problem with our 2007 Odyssey was a shorted electrical fuse which led to replacing the factory-installed battery. And since then everything is perfectly okay. My family and I love this car because it possess enough power, comfortable to drive, roomy and has an excellent safety features. Generally, Honda Odyssey or any other Japanese cars are very reliable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had this ody since July 2007, it is our 2nd ody. We have had only minor problems, problems with the back bumper after dealer installed trailer wiring and that's it. Only changed the oil and rotated the tires. No shaking, pulling hesitation etc. just a good all around vehicle. I average 19.2mpg city and hwy. The vehicle's traction control works great up here in Alaska, but I do use dedicated studded snow tires. Road noise is much better than the last model (2002 ody), but still noticeable, actually it's not much quieter than my 2005 ford diesel. Kids love the car too, we put an alpine dvd player in it, which is easy for them to use. So this vehicle is easy to like.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Van drives like a truck. Bad front end. New tires did not help. Dealership just makes excuses. Brakes squeak and factory rep and dealership say to read the owners manual and it will say you may have squeaky brakes. They will not correct them. Owners manual comes after the purchase.

<TEXT>Like many other owners we too are having transmission issues. We just had to the dealer for the transmission "judder" fix, but guess what? It's worse than it was before! Vehicle shakes at 25 MPH while transmission hunts for a gear, especially on hills. There is also an intermittent shake at highway speeds (70 MPH) that I no longer believe has anything to do with tires or alignment, but with the drivetrain itself. Like others when entering/exiting ECO mode there is too much noise from the transmission. The VCM system does not seem to improve gas mileage so I say Honda should eliminate it. We've had 7 Hondas now and this is the first and only Odyssey we will own.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this van brand new without knowing that the tire system was different. All four tires unevenly wear out after 20,000 miles on it (e.g. they wear out on one edge of the tires but not the other side). I brought it to Firestone and it was said that the alignment was bad which killed the tired. I brought it to Honda's dealer and all they said was that they were not responsible and I had to pay nearly $1,500 to replay a new tire. It's sad. We have purchased 4 Honda and surely this van would be the last one. In addition, this van is not very fuel economy (e.g. 20 miles on freeway and 15 miles in the city, bad!!!. Don't purchase it if you don't want to pay more than it's worth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Sorry to blast a vehicle that is so highly rated but mine has had recurring problems and they appear to be electrical. When I turn the lights on the dash lights go off; the cruise control only works on occasion; have been to Dealer 3 times to correct a bad tire pressure sensor-still not working and light still on; the battery has been replaced twice in a year. All in all, this is my first and probably last Honda product because it has left me stranded 8 times in one year with a dead battery. My 14 yr old Quest never stranded me once...</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my replacement for a domestic van we had owned. I think the American brands will return to the top soon if this Honda van is any indication. Van has 23k mi currently and has a series of issues. Bad fuel economy, trans problems, engine pinging. My service reps all respond to these problems like its news to me. However once you inform them of the tech serv bulletin TSB they relent. I think Honda needs to get back in the game with superior eng/ and quality. This is my 5th Honda and possibly my last. I hope Honda steps up to the plate with this warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently purchased a 2007 Odyssey to replace our 2002 Odyssey which was totalled in an accident. We have not been as happy with the 2007 as we were with the 2002. The 2007 is bulkier to drive, harder to park, shifts rough between 20-30 km/h, and uses way more gas! 14-17 mpg in city driving is what we are getting and we were told it would be better than that. We are truly disappointed with the gas mileage of the 07. How can a vehicle be fun to drive when you can literally see the gas gauge moving towards empty as you are driving?</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought this 07 Odyssey and have only had it 1 week, but so far this vehicle is very well built, extremely comfortable, and performs and handles very well for a minivan. First tank of gas I averaged 20 mpg with mostly city driving. I'm expecting this to improve as the engine breaks in. I read one review that said they got 14mpg on a tank and I couldn't believe it, how were you driving? In fact, most of the negatives I read about this vehicle was on gas mileage, but I guess those people never owned SUV's. I traded a Mitsubishi Endeavor SUV which was a great vehicle, but we wanted the extra seats and better fuel mileage. So far, so good. I'll write another review when I get more miles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power sliding doors especially when carrying the little one, moonroof, heated seats, and Variable Cylinder Management that cuts off 3 cylinders when cruising or coasting - it's a real gas saver! Figure out how to optimize this and you will see a huge improvement in MPGs. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Mileage on the sticker is a pure lie and cheating. In growing family, the gas expense is burden now. When asked dealer, they said 16 for city and highway combined is good. Per dealer, can get sticker mileage if driven without A/C, heater, radio, navigation, DVD and at smooth 55mph. Sure, why do they have these feature than? Why are they selling in cold Chicago? If DVD has to be off, why put it in? Minor touch of metal or so creates dent due to thin paint coat. No MP3 format player, no iPod outlet for such an expensive vehicles. Does not have mileage calculator built into Nav system. Same software used in Acura and others, should have throwns into this.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Except for the driver's armrest, it's a fairly comfortable car, and we really like it, but it could be better. I get the feeling Honda tried to save costs at the expense of consumers' comfort and convenience. Honda took out the revolving tray in the floor space and the adjustable armrests which were features in the 2006 Honda EX. The driver's armrest is not very good. For the exterior, they should have racks with the roof rails.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Good acceleration, steering, and suspension for a minivan. Minor creaking and body flex noise when starting from a stop. Also, when stopping, transmission is clunky and feels like it is "pushing" you forward. Overall, by far the best reliable performance for the money. Was surprised about the clunky transmission for a Honda. Highway mileage so far 24.5 (at 75-80 mph)-not bad for a 5200lb. vehicle (loaded) with a V-6. Rear DVD is worth its weight in gold for kids. Radio signal reception is poor. More road noise than I expected. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We were sold on the first test drive - this is a beautiful car to drive. Wish we'd stepped up to the Touring for a couple of reasons. 'XM ready' means a $600 installation fee which really annoyed us as, frankly, false advertising. And it doesn't have automatic headlights! This is not only annoying (any old GM car has them) but dangerous - especially when the dash lights are so bright it makes you thinks the lights are on when they're not.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Honda. Fortunately we leased the vehicle and it will be going back to the dealer. Nice exterior, more than enough power, better features over the same priced Toyota. Main complaint the window sticker says MPG (18/25) and we get 14/22 under normal driving conditions, 12 MPG in summer when air conditioner is running. We lease vehicles and then buy since we do not trust manufacturers. Honda should be ashamed that they mislead consumers with MPG ratings. This only confirms our suspicions are true. </TEXT>

<TEXT>3 factors led us to buy a minivan. The first was we were expecting a 3rd child and needed a car with more room. The second was we wanted a vehicle that would make our numerous long roadtrips more comfortable than our existing cars (Prius and S4 Avant) could. And the third was we didn't want a SUV. When considering which minivan to buy we took the advice of so many auto reviewers in the press and plumped for an Odyssey. After more than 6 months of ownership we are largely impressed with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently bought an 07' Odyssey EX which was replacing a 2004 Tahoe and we're so happy with our new purchase. Much more useable space, easier entry/exit, better gas mileage, safety with all of those airbags. We love being able to walk thru b/w the front seats to get to the kids in the back. Great acceleration/handling for a minivan, car-like driving. A few improvements would be larger cup holders in center console (minor). Better base stereo system (sounds ok but signal not strong- probably weak antenna). Sometimes when slowing down and transmission is downshifting it feels like you get bumped from behind, kind of pushes you forward even with the brakes on. All in all very happy 9/10</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought the 2007 Honda Odyssey and I love it. I was driving a 2003 Chevy Tahoe which I thought I couldn't live without until I drove the Odyssey. This van handles wonderfully and is very comfortable, not to mention the excellent gas mileage. We traded in our Tahoe because we were so tired of pouring gas into it. At about $70 to fill it up; we were dying! The Odyssey costs about $45 to fill it up! We couldn't beleive it. The road noise is worse than I had hoped, our Tahoe was very quiet but was also high off the ground. It is very easy to get my 18 month old in & out of the van, no more climbing up to load him in his car seat! I love it; even though I said I'd never drive a van!</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far 800 miles and enjoy the car. Very roomy with good added features like AC power outlets, magic third row. Car is not sporty since it lacks the low torque power but still can handle the roads when needed. Kids love the car with the nav and can't get them to get out. Drives well considering it's a minivan and road pavement is more pronounced since it has pax run flat tires (basically a steel tire inside a tire). The ex model is much quieter. 18in wheels are low profile and looks aggressive. The Sienna looks docile. Since we just purchased it will update review when it snows since we live in northeast. Wanted awd but not an option. Can't believe Honda doesn't have one available like Sienna. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The space! Isn't that why you buy the car? Full third row, smooth ride, nav is one of the best (we have a mercedes, audi and bmw and this nav is the best of them all). 18inch wheels are low profile. Like the aggressive front end - the Sienna looks more like a box. </FAVORITE>

After the first test drive all of the kids were upset we left without buying one (our 4 year old cried), but we wanted a different color and a little better price. We really love everything inside the van, the backup mirror, dvd, storage space, and comfort of the seats in the rear are the best features.

<TEXT>This is one of the most uncomfortable vehicles I have ever been in. It is noisy(a constant hummm), the transmission runs very rough, and the dvd screen constantly squeaks. The van also has a vibration problem which you can feel and easily see when looking at the seats and the steering wheel. It never goes away (not even when a/c is off). The inside of the van is very nice and roomy. The front seats are way to high for short people though. I am 5'3" and only the tips of my toes touch the floor. Hard to reach pedals Wish I bought something else. Maybe that new toyota that didnt even start at the dealership would have been a better buy...at least then I would have no vibration worries</TEXT>

Our highway mileage has been a bit dissapointing, but we do push the speed limit and have been around 21 mpg on the highway. Our first tank of gas was the dealer tank and went about 17 mpg. The room is amazing. All the amenities are smartly done. The RES is an excellent option. With an adaptor, my son's video ipod can hook up in the back to watch videos he has on the ipod. The PS2 is also a fixture in the rear of the vehicle. The drive is excellent and the quality is outstanding. I would highly recommend this vehicle for a family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! I have been driving sports sedans and SUVs up to this point and this is my first minivan. We bought it and immediately took a 9 hr. trip up to Lake Tahoe with the kids and all the gear. This thing has a ton of room. It is very comfortable and actually fun to drive. Drives very much like a car. The engine is great with a lot of pick up for it?s size and engine type. Read the reviews here at Edmunds and sites like Motor Trend and you will see that this is the best in the class.

Caravan, looks uglier with each new generation and resale value should equal price of a decent TV in a few years. My Odyssy is pretty good inside and out, engine is very quiet, ride is smooth, and overall, structure is very tight. Combine that with a roomy interior, easy access to 3rd row, and a decent list of standard features. Lastly, since it is a Honda, you'll know that resale value will fare better than others - I should know, I traded in my old Caravan. Lastly, with end of model year, you should be able to get pretty close to invoice price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just love this vehicle. It is fun to drive and has plenty of enjoyable features. I expect the reliability to be the same as all the other Hondas I have owned. This is my first Honda van. I always had a GM product but the last one pushed me away. The leather in this vehicle is beautifull. The integrated dvd and nav system works great. Love the voice command prompts but still need to learn the lingo. Vehicle is tight, no rattles. Drives more like a sedan than a truck. Can't wait to take it on a long trip. Back up camera is great. Removes that fear of not seeing what is right behind you. I highly recomend this van. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Honda after looking at the top three rated this year - Toyota, Honda, Kia. The Toyota didn't have as much bang for the buck as the Honda, not as many creature comforts. The Kia has terrible depreciation, so would have to have a big-time Gap Insurance, and is cheap looking. The Odyssey has been great. We've taken it to 3 dogs shows, tons of room for crates, grooming supplies, luggage with room to spare. Comfortable ride and GREAT mileage! It gets much better mileage than my little Malibu,and there's hardly any road noise! We've owned the big Dodge custom vans, a Ford Aerostar etc., so we're not newcomers to the van market. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Quick notes: (1) How can this car be without day time running lights? (2) Some of the interior feels cheap. (3) The passenger side armrest is an ergonomically AWFUL and skeletally unfriendly design (you will need muscle relaxers on a long ride). (4) This car guzzles gas. Driving just a mere 14 miles cost me a quater of a tank. You can practically see the fuel gauge move. (5) The second row middle seat is a poor design and the storage entry below seems not thoughtfully designed. The hand sized opening is ridiculous in view of the cavernous storage area. You cannot possibly reach items that are not within a few inches from the opening, but there is no way to keep items close to the opening.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Really, no other minivan has the same well balanced list of virtues. Easily the best handling minivan we test drove. Interior is well appointed with excellent build quality. The cabin abounds with thoughtful touches, such as the cabin view mirror built into the sunglass holder - allowing you to keep an eye on everyone in back without having to turn around. The engine is flawless, true to Honda's reputation. We went with the EX to get the standard 8th seat and dual power sliding doors. Unless you are looking for an ultra cheap, stripped down minivan, the Odyssey is the only minivan you need to consider. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very pleased with the seating and leg comfort. It is important to have good seats and leg room in the second and third rows, which Honda offers over the other two competitors. Having driven Lincolns for years comfort was #1 priority and the Honda Touring gives you all and more. Gas mileage has been in the range of 20/22 town/hwy, and 25/26 hwy on recent 4,000 mile trip. Use of cruise control does give better mileage. I am impressed with the mileage as this van is 235lbs heavier than a Lincoln TC. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have put approximately 10,000 miles on the van since I purchased it. It has a smooth ride and more than adequate power. The DVD and nav systems have been great. I have noticed that gas mileage is not as advertised (3-5 mpg less than on sticker). Also as time goes by, the driver's seat has become a problem. As I come to a stop (slow or fast) the seat slightly shifts forward with an audible click. As I hit the gas (slow or fast) it shifts slightly back and clicks again. Dealership serviceperson states that he felt the shift and click but tested another van in the lot and it did the same thing so it must be normal. (What???).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just received the EX-L on July 2nd. First gas mileage was 19 MPG (mixed). The first highway MPG was 28.8. Air temp 70F, speed 62-66 mph, small rolling hills, with a light load. Starts and stops can be much smoother than with my 2000 Subaru Outback, (220,000 miles). The all-windows-down when unlocking and many safety features are great. For example, if the sliding door window is down the door will only open 75%. I plan on the van lasting 250,000 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have 4 children and needed a family vehicle to replace the Expedition which is not family friendly. The Odyssey is perfect for our needs. We have 2 children in car seats and the two captains chairs in the 2nd row make it easy to get the kids in and out of while the two older ones can easily get to the 3rd row (not so in the Expedition). Traveling is great. It's quiet and the remote for the DVD makes watching movies a breeze. I love the remote sliding doors. I'm pretty satisfied with gas mileage averaging out at 22 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We took delivery of our 07 Odyssey only to be greeted by a dead battery the next day. The battery was found to be defective and the battery was replaced. The van is currently back at the dealership for replacement of the rear brake discs with 300 miles on the vehicle. THe service advisor defined this situation as "lot rot." I will presume that these are just issues that need to be worked out with delivery but so far this is the least reliable initial quality for any vegicle I have ever experienced. This is our first Honda but we have previously purchased new 3 Fords, 1 Saturn, 1 Chevrolet and 1 Saab and have never had any delivery issues like we have experienced with this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With 2 kids and their grandparents' visiting about every 3 months, we needed a versatile, comfortable, safe and reliable vehicle. A crossover was not an option since we needed a vehicle that allowed us to "walk" (not contort / crawl) to the back and take care of a newborn. Test drove the Odyssey, Sienna, Quest and Entourage. Sienna-drive too trucklike and more expensive for same amenities. Hyundai drove well, but interior looked and felt cheap. Quest was not well built+expensive. Just bought this so no report on the MPG, but the overall report thus far is great! Smooth, quiet, car-like ride. Lots of room for storage and kids. Thoroughly tested everything in it B4 buying and all works great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My new 2007 Honda Odyssey drives and performs relatively well, but there were two key areas where I am simply not satisfied. My biggest disappointment is in the Odyssey's horrible gas mileage, far less that what is quoted by Honda. I only get 15 mpg in city. At over $3 per gallon, this is outrageous. I can almost see the fuel gauge dropping as I'm driving down the road. In addition, Honda Co. decided to save money at the consumer's expense by no longer including basic items like cargo netting, middle row compartment lazy Susan, etc. in their 2007 models, as they have in previous years. It was a let down to find this out after purchasing the vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The van itself is really good. However, the PAX tires are HORRIBLE!! Paid extra to get the touring edition, after 29,000 miles, tires were worn out. Had to wait over a week to get new tires in, cost over $200 per tire to replace. Brushed one up against a curb and the part of the brand new tire peeled off. Honda would not replace it. I feel like I was ripped off by the PAX tire and by Honda's lack of willingness to take responsibility for the problem. The tires wear out quickly and are difficult to get replaced in a timely manner. This is the only tire available for the touring edition. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2007 Honda Odyssey with 8,000 miles started taking my sleep away. Within a month of buying this van, transmission of sound from DVD system to wireless earphones failed, for which internal wiring had to be replaced and rewired. Within a week from this incident, DVD system started malfunctioning and it was replaced. Soon after this the CD/radio was replaced to cure a fault. Next was a passenger seat in the middle row which was jamming; it was replaced too. Front wipers were waiting to break next. My van is with the dealer now to fix them. I wonder if anything in the van will remain as a factory installed equipment at the end of three-year / 36,000 miles warranty. </TEXT>

Tons of luggage room, fit family of four, luggage and dog comfortably. On its maiden voyage, we achieved 26.5mpg on average, round trip. Used cruise control, kept speed at or below 70. Kids love the back seats compared to the Dodge "stow and go" which were very uncomfortable. In-floor storage is cavernous, tons of cup holders, easy access to back seat. Seating for 8, but don't do more than 7. The 3.5L V-6 has tons of pickup. Very impressed with accelleration.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2nd Odyssey replacing one purchased in 2000. Honda "fixed" my previous complaints with the '00, including having a 5 speed, leather heated seats, is much quieter, moonroof and a exterior temperature display. The folding rear seat is improved with headrests that don't come off and the whole thing collapses easier. Spare tire relocated to the back cabin making room for extra storage in the second row floor. HWY mileage improved tp 27 MPG with variable cylinder shutoff despite the engine horsepower now at 255 from 210 in '00. All that said, what I like most about the Odyssey is its car like ride. It simply drives wonderful, with hardly any body roll. Drive a GM van and you'll understand.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was finally able to convince my wife to upgrade our '03 4Runner with an '07 Sienna LE-8 Pkg 4 for the added convenience, space, and comfort. But before heading to the Toyota dealer, we thought to give the Pilot and Odyssey a final look. We ultimately left the Honda dealer a couple hours later in an Ody EX-L w/RES/NAV because of the trim level's standard features and equipment. Aside from the significant gap between actual fuel economy we have experienced over 2K of mixed city/hwy driving versus. EPA ratings, our other main issue is that access to the 3rd row requires folding, or completely removing, the PlusOne seat in the 2nd row when our girls' carseats are installed on the outer seats.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This '07 Ody Touring is a great upgrade over our '01 Ody EX in design, performance and ride quality. The Ody Touring is the best package by far. The Touring has better ride quality (better comfort and less noise) than the EX-L. So far, we drove about 900 miles in a little over one month. Mileage is only 17-18 mpg for 50-50 local and highway with A/C on and some waiting at the takeout lines. Considering the weight of the van, it's acceptable.

<TEXT>We purchased the van at the end of December and have put a little over 3000 miles on it. I had a 2005 Toyota Sienna which I traded in that was probably the most annoying car I've ever owned with its transmission problems and clunks, clanks, squeaks, groans, etc. So far the van has done very well with the following exceptions: 1. It has a chirping, scraping, hissing noise that isn't real loud but it is annoying especially at 30 mph and 1500 RPM-louder when you first start out. 2. Gas mileage is poor-17 combined city and highway and 19 on the highway. 3. It misses when idling and jumps a bit when the AC compressor goes on & off.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We researched the Sienna and this one and finally went for the odyssey because it drove better and looks better overall than the Sienna, in my opinion. On the inside, they are both pretty competitive and I did not find anything that stood out that was better than the other. The Sienna had all these confusing package options with not all option packages that you like available in all regions. This is a mess. On the contrary Honda has implemented a simpler scheme where you have 4 or 5 basic packages and individual accessories on top on them to choose from. A nice van overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove my van off the lot once, after the papers were signed.. Big mistake.. Bad vibration in the steering wheel. Service Director is great, but after 7 service visits I'm a little irritated. Oil leak, still trying to determine from where. Engine backfired today. The tires and wheels have been replaced once working on the second time. I wish I had better things to say.. OH, my gas mileage finally improved when I hit 5,000 miles, I average 19 in the city! I think the steering is a little to sensitive so I seem to oversteer a lot. It does great in the snow. The seats are very comfy. The interior plastic scratches really easy, so I tell the kids don't kick it or let the seat belt hit it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The dual heat A/C control. The Body style is really sporty. The seats are very comfortable. I went on a 8 hour trip and didn't have any problems. I love the 6 C/D changer.

<TEXT>Bought first of year, and have loved it so far. Extremely comfortable for all passengers, drives almost like a car, and the build/material quality makes it feel like a bit more expensive vehicle. We have friends with a $50K Lexus GX470, which is nice, but doesn't feel like it's worth twice as expensive as the EX-L. We added our own DVD system, so the only thing missing is Navigation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have put 12,000 miles on our 2007 EX- L and so far it's been a very reliable and enjoyable car. The car drives smoother and has better performance than the Sienna. Interior features are well done and laid out. They went cheap on a few interior parts being made of cheap plastic. Overall interior comfort is really nice and it's a great car to take on long road trips. The floor storage is also a nice feature, but the the thing that got me to buy the Honda over Toyota, was the way the seats folded and set up some much easier than the Toyota. I also notice the steering rack is not as smooth as the Toyota, but I just got it replaced and it's much smoother. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was one of those... "I'll never own a mini-van..." But, after having 2 kids and adopting 2 more, I had little choice. I eventually got up the nerve to drive it to the bus stop.

We are VERY impressed with the features, ride, CONVENIENCE and drive. The seats are comfortable, the interior spacious and it looks sharp! The rear entertainment system is a dream come true and I love the stow away 8th seat! This van replaced an '06 double- cab Toyota Tundra which I dearly loved. However, the gas mileage I now get sure softens the blow....</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really enjoy this mini van. I have had Dodge, and Chrysler previously- after a while problems with engine and electronics. So I decided I would buy either Honda or Toyota. I really enjoy the easy access front seat to back to attend to baby. I like that both doors slide open and the back door window go down as well. It drives very smooth and it gives a family of 5 plenty of room. It has been great when we travel. I do not feel squeezed in. I feel that I have plenty of room. I would recommend this vehicle. The AC and heat work great. I live in Texas so the AC is a BIG deal!!! The stereo system that came with the model is very good as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband talked me into buying a minivan because it would be more economical. Out of all of the minivans we test drove the Honda Odyssey was the best, with the Toyota Sienna in a close second. However if you are wanting an economical car with good gas mileage do not buy this van. There is many cool features such as the rear view camera, Rear Entertainment Center, the fact that you can open and close the doors and hatch. But overall I do not think it is worth the money. Therefore we took it back and are getting the GMC Acadia. Seriously check the Acadia out I think it is the best crossover on the market.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this van at the end of January after being torn between this and the Toyota Sienna. I must say that I usually agonize over large purchases, and this was no exception. We went with the Honda because we got a great deal and because, frankly, I've always wanted one because of it's fine reputation. It was probably a bit more than the Sienna, but Honda's new car financing rates were better. I feel that the interior reeks of quality, and the body style is much more appealing than any of the other vans out there. I was not disappointed, and I don't think you will be either. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stowable third seat in second row, the ability to slide 2nd row seats without lifting them completely out of the van, split bench in the rear, nice body style.

<TEXT>Finally went back to Honda van because of good gas mileage for a van, rear comft seats that went into well; comfortable other seats, leather, moonroof, great driving ability for van class,and great hauling capability for two going-to-be retired couple,plus low platform and again comfort for the aging population. Also excellent design to see outside windows and to park. We had the original van,then went to a Nissan quest and then to the Villager Estate(mercury). We wanted to leave the seats in and have the back like an old fashion 70's station wagon but front comfort of a van. Honda filled the bill again.

<TEXT>We just moved up from a 2000 Odyssey. The difference is absolutely astounding. The 2007 is quieter, has more power, and is significantly upgraded on the interior. We've only had the 07 for a few weeks so gas mileage, etc. has not been really checked yet. My only complaint is with the IPOD Music Link system which is just awful. We were told the Music Link would work through the radio and Nav system, this turned out to be a false statement. The only good news is our dealer has agreed to pull the Music Link system out and give us a full refund. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased Ody EX on Dec, 14th and took a 600 mile trip to Kansas City with the family. There was some pronounced noise on very course pavement, but overall much quieter than our 1999 Honda Ody. The overall gas mileage was 22 mpg..not bad with headwinds to and from our destinations. The engine has lots of power during acceleration onto freeways or in town. Cornering is great even on tight turns. Seats are firm but comfortable. Instruments are well positioned. Really like the small light that shines on the tray between the front passenger/driver seats as it allows you to see your cell phone or whatever in on the tray without turning on the reading/dome lights.

<TEXT>This is a excellent riding vehicle with many worthwhile safety features. Although the engine has an ECO mode the overall MPG is only 15. The lowest mileage has been 12 and the highest is 22 during the three months we have owned this vehicle. Our previously owned 'O4 Sienna got about 5-6 mpg more for the same type of driving. Access to the third row seat was easier in our Toyota Sienna. The PAX (run flat) tires are nice to have but will cost significantly more to replace that conventional tires. The navigation system is easy and fun to use but frequently comes up with,"entering unverified area" on some of our routes. We liked our Sienna better but this is still an excellent minivan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Honda Odyssey that I've purchased as a new vehicle from the dealer. After about 30,000 miles a problem developed with a noise (sounds like an old clunker). It sounds like a transmission or a valve noise on acceleration, especially on the highest gear when the car is under even slight load. Honda is stating (per Honda Engineer) that this is a normal noise, even thought Honda dealer already replaced shields, transmission torque converter and other parts, but they refuse to actually fix it. They have done about $3,000 worth of repairs and they refuse to replace a transmission, which is probably cause of this noise. I Will Not Buy Honda ever again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Two issues with my Odyssey. First it shakes when you are slowing down. The dealer stated it was due to tire pressure. Took it in and it still shakes. Second my van was steaming and hissing one day. I took it into the dealer. The service guy did a 15 sec. look over and informed me that it was probably a hole in the condenser caused by a rock. He said they would have to perform a check that would take an hour and that this would not be covered by my warranty as it was not a factory defect. Guess what, yep the check revealed that it was a small hole caused by a rock. How he knew that was beyond me. Cost with the check was over 1200.

We have a 06 Odyssey EXL N+R with 33K miles and it drives and rides like it just came out of the showroom. So the 06 will have 150K in another 4 years. We could have gotten a ford product since my dad works for them but they would never hold the value. If they ever come out with a VOLVO Van we may consider it but until such time Its the Odyssey. Yeah it might be a tank, but it can do so much for so little. </TEXT>

<TEXT>New in 2007: 1) Telescopic steering wheel(great if over 6') 2) Tire Pressure Monitor which alerts the driver if one of the tires experiences loss in air pressure 3) Coin Holder in center dash cup holders. The leather seats are very comfortable and the front captain seats offer electric heating for those in colder climates. The instrument panel is very intuitive & the design/lighting is the best I have viewed. Odyssey is filled with safety features from the front, side & curtain airbags along with sliding side doors that will stop if they encounter any resistance. VCM feature shuts down one bank of cylinders when coasting, thus increasing fuel economy. I highly recommend the Odyssey</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honda continues to build a great vehicle with so many features, plenty of power, and comfort necessary for those long trips. The ride is smooth and quiet but yet there's plenty of power in reserve when you need it. All the leather seats are very comfortable and actually fit an adult over 6' tall (a major selling point for me). We didn't purchase the touring because the additional features were not needed and the consensus was that there are still issues with the run-flat tires that need to be worked out. I think the parking sensors should be standard - instead I will be purchasing them from Bernardi Parts. This van has the same turning radius of my '95 accord!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second Odyssey. We cannot believe the difference in refinement and performance over the '99, which we thought was a very good vehicle. Great drivetrain - smooth, powerful engine (drive by wire throttle is very responsive), excellent shifts. The audio system is not great, but if you want to spend a bit more money, upgrade with aftermarket stuff. Very cool NAV system (voice activated). XM radio was a nice touch. The interior is very well laid out, high quality. Would have been nice to have a 110volt outlet, but we'll make do. Also, I prefer the cruise control on my '97 M3 - why do you need 4-5 buttons to control it when one stalk will do? Great job, Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great minivan. The RES is A+. We have a Dodge Grand Caravan as well and this vehicle is far superior. Test drove a pilot as well. This Van was more flexible for getting people in and out of it than the pilot. The leather interior is very nice and the heated seats are great! The car has a very tight turning radius compared to our Dodge. The interior controls are laid out nicely. The steering wheel radio controls are a bonus. Opted not to get the touring model because of the required run-flat tires. (Costly to replace) Did not have a need for the navi so I opted not to get it. Me and my wife now fight to drive this vehicle. The stereo system is weak and the speakers are lame! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Touring model is vastly different in ride, handling, and drivability than EX. Took home an EX-L w/dvd on Saturday and the van had a shimmy in it and front end groaned on slight bumps. The tires were noisy and the radio was the pits. Not too hot for $35K. Back to the dealership on Monday and drove the Touring - light years ahead. Was able to "upgrade" for more money and am very happy execpt for the so-so speakers. It drives as well as my S420 Mercedes. If you can afford the Touring, drive it last and you'll take one home. Don't be fooled by the run flat sticker shock. $190 if you have to buy one from the dealer. Michelin will warrant them for 2 years @ no cost if + 50% tread left. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a 2007 Odyssey EX-L during Honda's annual clearance event in October 2007 and saved about $4K on MSRP. The EX-L has the VCM (variable cylinder management) feature that shuts off up to 3 cylinders when not needed. It is very unnoticeable to all but the most expert drivers and adds up to an average fuel economy over 25 mpg with every tank of gas for our family. We added an Alpine Overhead DVD system for the kids and saved another $1K versus getting the EX-L with factory DVD, besides the Alpine has a bigger screen, "mommy controls" and game playing features that the factory DVD does not have. We added luggage racks and use our Thule Roof Box for cross country trips for added comfort.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>VCM (Variable Cylinder Management), Overdrive Button, and Sunroof. The VCM in the EX-L or Touring models saves you money weekly by getting 3-4 MPG more than a Odyssey EX or LX models paying for itself in less than 4 years plus you get leather seats and a sunroof. The overdrive button is handy.</FAVORITE>

Said he'd seen several of these. He ordered the part, will drop the transmission and fix it. Or so I hope. I'll soon find out. Everything else about the Odyssey is great. Though I do wish the Touring model came with a third seat in the middle. It is so great to be able to open the doors in bad weather as I'm approaching the car & just plop my smalls and groceries without getting soaked.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did not have any transmission problems until I had my Odyssey for about a year. I have had it into the dealer three times and they tell me that there is not a problem. Apparently, they hook it up to a computer and it tells them there is not a problem, so no problem exists in their mind. My vehicle chronically searches for a gear at low speeds. It also has a shake to it when trying to maintain a lower speed. The dealer looks at me like I'm crazy, but I have 2 other friends with Odysseys and the same complaints. I wish Honda would stand behind their product before their reputation is ruined for good. This is SO disappointing. We traded in our Toyota van for Honda and wish we hadn't.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle for the many features my Honda model offers, such as storage capability, number and placement of cup holders, GPS Navigation system, DVD player, and the list goes on. One feature I thought I was going to appreciate was the run flat tires on this model. I was wrong thinking that. I have had three flat tires in 18 months, with two repairs costing about $125, with the third requiring replacement of the tire. That bill was about a car payment in value. Lucky for me I had purchased the extended road hazard insurance for the tires. It takes the dealer about 4-5 hours to repair the tire, purely outrageous.</TEXT>

<TEXT>While this is often rated the best minivan, I have found some critiques that are real. First, the pulley on the crankshaft cracked at 22k miles. We also have been having funny shifting patterns at 1500rpm and 35-45mph that the dealer claims is 'normal' 'Grade-Logic' - nevertheless it sure is not smooth despite 2 attempts for them to evaluate. Too bad since I waited to buy this 2007 model when Honda secretly changed the transmission without telling customers (since the older one was failing also). The ride is noisier on the highway than we hoped. Wish mileage was better than the 17-18 we average. It's big and you can feel it twist and hear rattles in the doors over bumps. I expected more.</TEXT>

My mom has a 2002 with 155k miles and still drives like new. So, decision made. It is no where near as comfy as the Caddy. But I cannot compare it to a Caddy because, well, that wouldn't be fair. The van drives tight. It has good acceleration when asked. The interior has so far been kid-proof. The automatic side doors are a must for kids. No worries of them flinging a door open into other cars when parked. I put almost 20k miles per year on it. It is doing well and I hope to run it for many more years, and still profit </TEXT>

<TEXT>We've owned our Odyssey for about 1 year and have put about 15K miles on it without any issues. We kept our 2001 Mazda MPV and I use it as a work vehicle.

It's bit clumsy to drive at times, but for a vehicle of this size and weight its no bad. I'm amazed at the complaints about gas mileage. How anyone could get 12-13 MPG on the highway must something mechanically incorrect that needs to be evaluated.

Fuel mileage is a best of 27.6 on hwy and 19.8 in town. I was hesitant on the PAX tires but a local retailer will sell them for $160/tire.

As far gas mileage, I get about 22 on the highway, not the 13-15 people state here. Of course I am careful to keep the "ECO" light on. I like the versatility the Odyssey offers and it is a great vehicle for the family especially with my little boy, and getting his car seat in and out and hauling the sttoller. Plus I like the roof rack on the touring so I could mount my roof box and haul some additional stuff.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Odyssey primarily for long road trips. It's been fantastic. Plenty for room for everyone, no one complains about being cramped anymore. It's so comfortable inside that long drives are much less fatiguing. The main reason I picked the Honda is because of its great handling. It's seriously better than most SUVs and even some cars. There have been a lot of comments about the fuel economy. The vehicle is heavy, so its city mileage is poor. But on the highway with 6 people & 4 bikes on a hitch rack, I get 22 to 25 mpg on the highway. Better than my 4 door sedan with bikes on the roof! In summary, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a minivan, especially if you like to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I read several of the previous reviews and had to comment. I am surprised at how many Odyssey owners are so disappointed. I guess we are lucky. I think its perfect. The fuel economy is never going to be what the sticker says on any vehicle. We all bought the van because we had to haul multiple people. The more you haul, the heavier the van and the lower your fuel economy. Improve your driving habits, properly inflate your tires, etc. and you'll get better fuel economy. It drives smooth, handles well, strong engine, good looks, luxurious, and storage is great. I've driven Sienna, Grand Caravan, Uplander, Freestar, Sedona, SUVs in the last two years. Hands down winner is Odyssey. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I put on 2000 miles a month. I get about 20 mpg in town, and 23-25 on the highway at 60-65. At 70-75 on the interstate, it's about 22 mpg. Nothing to complain about there. The car is more comfortable than the Grand Caravans I've owned, or than my son's 08 Sienna. The feel on the road is much better than the Sienna for me as a driver or passenger. I'll get about 35K on the PAX tires, and then I'll dump them and the rims. WheelMax has the replacements, and various Honda dealers online have the tire pressure sensors at $35 apiece. The whole switch will cost what new PAX tires would, and then anyone can repair/replace a blowout.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have mixed feelings about my Odyssey. I love the convenient features but I have had a few problems. We had vibrations/noise from the driver's side front area. After a second trip to the dealer it seems to be fixed. The steering column needed to be lubricated. I guess there is a "bulletin" out about this problem. Also, I had to have my rear bumper repainted because paint was peeling off! I had my front grill replaced due to a paint bubble.

<TEXT>We love our Odyssey. It very comfortable, sportier to drive than you'd think and we expect it to last a long time. The third seat has proven comfortable for adults on a 1.5 hour ride. What it doesn't do so well is haul cargo. The cargo floor is not perfectly flat or smooth. This seems to be a trade off for the easy to fold third row, parts of the hinges stick up. It's impossible to slide things in and out and if you have to crawl in and get something you are sure to scream when you land a knee on one of the hard plastic hinges. Likewise there is a lot of exposed hardware in the floor around the middle row than can get knees, toes and fingers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine and steering make this van very nice to drive - like a good sedan. Plenty of power even when loaded with six adults. We think it's quite inside on most pavement, though many reviews I read comment about road noise.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have seen many suggestions of a class action lawsuit in reviews regarding Honda's claim of MPG and the actual MPG that consumers have noted. I too am extremely disappointed that Honda claimed 26 MPG on the road for this vehicle. I am lucky to get 12/13 on the highway. Also, the shift is not smooth nor is the ride comfortable on a long trip. The lift gate is incredibly difficult to manage. I am constantly asking for assistance in the grocery store parking lot. No excuse for a door to be that difficult to lower, especially since an automatic was not an option on this model. I was so pleased with my Toyota Sienna, and definitely went "downhill" with this purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Three of the seat belts have a nick on the edge of the belt. I can tear the belt material with my hands at the nick. I understand these belts are design for tension force but should any belt develop a nick I sure the tensile force would be reduced. Honda quoted $385 to replace belt.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I purchased a new 2007 Honda Odyssey. It has been in the shop several times. Recently after having service completed for a defective steering pump, my wife lost control of her van when the steering wheel locked up. The van was towed and the service department claimed they accidentally replaced the defected steering pump with a defected steering pump. All that said, be careful buying a Honda Odyssey, the so- called "Honda Quality" is not all that it's worth. Please Be Careful!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Can't complain about the build or interior. Very poor gas mileage at 12- 13 MPG city. Been trying to drive like Grandma to see if it improves but even then it barely makes 15 MPG. And yes I'm on my 3rd oil change so it's broken in. It's a minivan so didn't expect 30 MPG but it's no where near what the sticker promised. The transmission is real chunky - shifts are not smooth and doesn't handle hills well which doesn't help the MPG. And handling isn't at all car-like - more like a truck. In this era of $4-5 gas the Odyssey just doesn't make sense - I would have been better off with a Sienna or a Caravan. I am really ticked off that Honda lied about the MPG - first and last Honda I buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I called myself researching extensively prior to purchase and overall I am pleased with many aspects of my Odyssey. the things I am most unhappy with seem trivial but I find annoying. My 1998 Explorer had more features than my 2007 EXL. Cannot charge my phone with ignition turned off;the radio is horrible and believe me I am not one to complain about radio sounds but this is very bad. The lights do not come on or off automatically; No MP3 or bluetooth ( I just assumed most of these features would be present- purchasing the next to top of the line) would have bought the touring except did not have option on tires. the bumper is scratched & i see this with most I see on the road. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I think the Honda Odyssey is the nicest car we have ever owned and plan on buying another one in a year or two. The only complaints we have are the difficulty of strapping oneself in with the seat belts as it seems to be too tight of a fit and we wish the second row seats folded into the floor as they do on the Dodge Caravan and other minivans. Minor complaints on an otherwise excellent car ! It's extremely quiet and comfortable to drive on the open highway. We love the rear view mirror and Navigational Aid which we use often. It has good get up and go when you need it. An overall excellent choice if you like minivans.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought Odyssey after driving a 2001 Caravan to 138K miles. The Caravan rode better than the Odyssey and got better mileage. Sorry, but it's true. We've taken a couple of long road trips (3,000+ miles) and the Ody does well, but it does seem louder than it should be and the mileage is very poor. The "3 cylinder" fuel saving pitch is a joke. Why can't it beat my 2001 Caravan in MPG? I'm very disappointed in the mileage. My wife an I are Realtors in our 40s and she wanted navigation because the map books are becoming harder to read when getting around. We do like the navigation but it seems to be 2 or 3 years behind in the streets included. Most newer neighborhoods are not in the GPS. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Odyssey is a great van, but Honda has misrepresented its fuel economy. The window sticker indicated the van would average 19 city and 26 hwy for mpg. After 10,000 miles the best I've seen is 22 mpg on the hwy and my average fuel economy has been 17 to 18 mpg. I anticipated my average fuel economy would be 22.5 mpg when purchasing the van. The reduction to 18 will cost me $5,700 if I drive it for 150,000 miles at $4.00 a gallon. Can I suggest class action law suit?</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had our '07 Honda Odyssey EXL-RES for about 6 months. Like everyone else says, the MPG is horrible. In the third month, dealer had to "replace the fuse box" because the wipers would only work on high, brights would not work, and car alarm would not arm - major annoyances. The exterior and interior of the van are nice. The shifting is VERY uneven and like another poster said, is very pronounced when coasting.

<TEXT>The main reason I came here is to say that I was able to avoid a head on collision and the Odyssey took it all in stride. An approaching car doing about 40 crossed into our lane as we were doing 40 (driver was texting). Two adults, a child, and an infant were on board the Ody. With a palm on the horn, I swerve HARD right towards the curbing, and then swerved HARD left to avoid the woods. The oncoming car missed the front left by inches and the van actually DRIFTED cleanly around the nose of the oncoming car as it passed within inches to our left flank. The van was totally composed with no roll tendency and the drift was corrected by the stability system.</TEXT>

As I approach 3rd gear (around 38-40 mph), there is a surge forward with the van, even if I don't have my foot on the gas at the time. Asked service person, and he said that unless the red light comes on the dashboard, they can't diagnose it. I wish I could trade it in, but I need the room for carpool for my grandchildren.

<TEXT>This van has too many design flaws when I compare it to my 8 year old Dodge Caravan which I traded in. I could tolerate design flaws but I cannot tolerate transmission bumps when shifting up and down shifting. The dealer's "expert" mechanic says that this is how all Honda minivans shift. Not comfortable to feel sudden bumps when going from 60 to 70 mph. Many Honda user forums also complain about this bump. The engine also makes a lot of noise when driven between 40-60 mph. The dealer again says that this is how it is. Unacceptable. The bumps and noise make driving experience horrible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This van turned out to be very noisy and hard riding. On the test drive the car performed well , had a good ride and didn't seem noisy. After arriving at home, I checked the tires as is my practice and found that the tires wee inflated at 28 psi although the door sticker says 36 is the recommended pressure. Think the dealer did this on purpose? I keep 32 psi in my tires. We took a 2000 mile trip right after the purchase and found the road and tire noise to be very bad and the rough ride made the trip very unpleasant. Gas mileage is 16-18. My 99 Chrysler T&C got better mileage and had a far more comfortable ride. It's a good looking vehicle but not the superior all-round on that I expected.</TEXT>

Don't know and the dealer says they would not be able to find it till it is happening which is never when I am in town or when they are open. I am thinking to trade it for a sienna. Never heard of not finding a problem like that. Don't they have computerized systems that find problems? Not happy with service at Springfield Honda so may trade. If I do, I will never buy another Honda. Want this dealt with before my warranty is up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Loved this car at purchase, now, five months later, its problems are obvious. Gas mileage for city driving is the worst -- low teens at best. Couple this with a transmission that is way too eager to downshift (the car will not coast at low speeds - foot must always be on the accelerator!) and you have the king of all gas guzzlers. The brakes are too soft and getting softer by the day -- really emphasizes the car's bulk when your leg hurts just trying to get it to stop. These flaws make it impossible to enjoy driving this car. I would expect these kind of issues from a so-so vehicle, but not a Honda! Won't be getting one again. Can't believe I miss my old Caravan. . . </TEXT>

<TEXT>Impressive overall, but does not shift as smoothly as the Caravan, although mileage has held at about 20 mpg (about the same as the Dodge). The controls are confusing, especially for a person accustomed to driving American-designed cars (are you listening Japan?). Power doors should have a disconnect feature to allow you to open them easy to open without power assist like the Dodge. Plush interior is on a par with my father-in- law's Avalon. Auto climate control for the rear zone, variable heat setting for the seats, roof rack bars, should be standard equipment at this trim level like on the Dodge. Love the van, but do not feel it is worth a $4,000 to $6,000 premium over the Dodge!</TEXT>

Now we get in our brand new Odyssey and the first thing I think is "I HATE THIS VAN" every time it rains all the windows fog up so bad we cant see, takes over an hour before they defog - told it's a common complaint. Gas mileage is worse than horrid. Impossible to get feet warm, unless you sit on them - heated seats work. Can't put anything under the console between the two front seats. If something even lightly touches the arm, the tray goes down, has only happened when the coffee cups are full and of course hot. Can't drive with the windows down, the noise is ear piercing.

If you do town driving and like good MPG then buy something else. MPG will get better after 15000. Transmission droning sound especially at 1500 RPM which is where it likes to stay is true, > or <1500 RPM gets rid of the drone. Pay extra for rear parking assist.

<TEXT>Overall the van is OK, but the mileage is awful! Nowhere near the EPA posted rating even with the +/- 3mpg. We found this shocking having owned a Honda Accord in the past and the gas mileage was one of the things we were happy about. Honda needs to investigate this issue and correct and not have the dealers tell the customer "it's hot in the summer" or "it must be the way you drive." Spring, summer, fall or winter and irrespective of how you drive, the gas mileage in the city will barely crack 14 mpg.</TEXT>

Overall the 2007 model design is an improvement over the 2004 model, but the execution has a lot to be desired. I noticed an engine drone noise at 180 miles. Honda says its characteristic of vehicle harmonics.(What nonsense!) At 400 miles noticed whining buzzing noise from power steering pump.

<TEXT>We bought ours new in March 2007. The interior heats up very quickly however, hardly any air comes out down by your feet. (Can't even feel it.) It will blow a little harder if you turn off your side air vents but then your side windows start to fog up. My sunroof leaks while in the car wash, have been sprayed right in the face many times. The windows will sometimes roll down by themselves, whether you are driving the van or in the store shopping. I was actually locked INSIDE the vehicle once. Everyone else got out and when I tried to, the door wouldn't budge. The locks were all up. I had to lock and unlock them to get out.

Things I hate- Rides too stiff. The power sliding door control is located on the driver side. No sliding door control on the b-pillar. Honda also cheaped out on the rear view camera and LCD screen for the navi. The rear view camera is not as clear nor as colorful as the Sienna, it is almost totally useless.

And as you can see,we only travel an average of 7500 miles per year!I would estimate the true MPG to be around 10 MPG CITY and about 18 MPG highway! Pathetic! I should have opted to keep the 2004 LX! Another factor to stay with the Odyssey was the convenience of the side door windows that can be opened. We hardly use them because of the excessive pounding, thumping wind noise that occurs when you're going over 15 MPH! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drives and handles great...except for the "hold-back' feel when you let off the accelerator...especially at low speeds..(must be the grade-logic? feature). Very roomy and functional ergonomic interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded our 05 Pilot because we needed the convenience of a mini van. Tested the Odyssey and Sienna. Althugh we liked the features of the Sienna more, the Odyssey drove and handled much better. Biggest dissapointment is with the fuel mileage. With our AWD Pilot we got about 19 overall. With the same type driving in our Odyssey we get 16. Also some minor interior rattles and creaks which are annoying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We went to the dealership to look at a used Pilot. The Odyssey was sitting next to it, so it was easy to compare them side by side. The Odyssey must be 50% bigger inside, with 3 rows of very roomy & comfortable seating for full- size humans--and the 07 van was only a couple grand more than the 04 Pilot. Adults wouldn't last long in the Pilot's 3rd row. The Odyssey sold itself on the test drive. There's lots of storage cubbies and cup holders galore. We had to give up 4WD, but you can't have everything. We're averaging 18 mpg, about what I hoped for. The certified used car warranty beats new car coverage. My wife loves driving the Odyssey, so it looks like we made the right decision. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wife is now happy! Roomy & flexible interior, nice design in & out, comfy seats, build quality, smooth ride, Accord-like handling, smooth quiet power, surprisingly tight turning radius helps maneuverability. Plenty of zip for climbing hills & merging onto freeways. Nice van, good value.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Odessey stands out from all competitors. Terrific ergonomics, high quality interior component design, materials and performance, great styling (considering it is a minivan) and lots of fun to drive. I was surprised at how well it handlesve preferring this to our Mercedes for in town driving. We are large dog people. An 85lb. lab lives like a king in the back with the center row seats in on long trips. I often use this rather than our pickup to haul loads. Expect 20MPG combined unless you drive at 50MPH average speed with infrequent stops. All EPA estimates are overstated. This is no exception.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Honda products have a unique distinctive look and feel. Consistent attention is given to the human interface across all product lines. I haven't been inside their jet, but their 5HP motor is one of the easiest and most widely used in power tools. It's always like visiting an old reliable friend.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this van to replace a full- size Chevy Express conversion van with an 8-cylinder engine. I was hoping for much better gas mileage with the Odyssey than I got with the big van. It hasn't happened. The very best mileage I've gotten with the Odyssey is 14 mpg, combined highway and city driving. I usually get around 12.9 mpg in the city. (I got better average mileage with the big conversion van and also with two previous 6-cylinder Acura Legends -- a 1989 & a 1993.) I'm hoping something is just wrong with the van and they can fix it. It's a fine van otherwise. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall quality; interior features such as heated seats, front controls for DVD, flexibility of seat configurations.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looked long and hard and having owned a 2001 ODY for past seven years we got our fifth Honda product ,a 2007 ODY Touring. We drove Chrysler T & C(top of line), 2008, Sienna 2008(T O L), Hyundai Entourage 2007 (Limited/Ultimate Pkge). Entourage would have been second choice but it couldn't match Honda's tight turning. The 2007 Honda reliability and fit and finish is still up to high standards. Handling is superb. Our old ODY was a really great reliable, inexpensive car to operate. I assume the 2007 will be the same. We are just "Honda " people. If you are one you'll know what's special about these vans</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great resale and reliability. Great ride/ handling. Inexpensive to own.Smooth, firm, secure ride. Powerful acceleration. Quieter than expected cabin.NAV is simple to operate. Run flat(PAX) tires hopefully will exceed expectations.Tight turning radius. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, despite reading about the MPG problems, the family bought an 07 Odyssey. We have owned 5 Hondas and have always been very happy with them. In fact, right now we have an 03 Accord and love it. With that said, the Odyssey is a comfortable vehicle. Unfortunately, the mileage is absolutely terrible! Over the course of 3k miles we have averaged 14 MPG. The Ford Explorer we replaced ave 16 MPG. We just can't seem to do better than 14 MPG regardless of how we drive. You can literally see the fuel guage going down. It stays on F for about 25 miles! All I can say with the price of gas going up make sure you explore your other options and know that the MPG warnings are true!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have kept a log on my gas mileage since purchasing my Odyssey in August of 07, and bought the Odyssey for its advertised gas mileage. I owned a Chrysler Town and Country for 10 years, and my 10 year old van got better gas mileage than this Odyssey. I'm getting 15 city and no more than 19.5 Hwy. My sticker advertises 19/26. It is very disappointing! Also, I have had trouble with the transmission being slow to change gears from Park to Drive. Took it in today and they put a computer update on the van to speed the delay, but it didn't work. It is also sluggish from 10-40 mph with the so called Economy feature kicking on and off to save gas! Poor engineering for gas mileage and transmission!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is roomy and comfortable. Has good pickup.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our 2007 Odyssey to replace a 2004 Toyota Sienna and I wish I could trade back! Fuel economy is unbelievably bad. We live in the country, about 30 miles from anywhere, and have yet to exceed 16mpg. I've tried setting the cruise on a relatively flat road and then reset the mileage calculator -- it still won't get better than 17. The instant fuel economy often drops to below 10mpg on level roads and seems to get worse when the 'ECO' light is on. The dealer said it's within the stated range so too bad. This performance should be embarrassing to Honda. The Odyssey is only marginally (1-2 mpg) better than my full-size, full-time 4x4 Expedition with a 5.4 liter V-8.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wireless headsets are great. Tire pressure display is nice.</FAVORITE>
