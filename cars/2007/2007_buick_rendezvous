<TEXT>I have owned my 2007 buick Rendezvous for over 2 years and have not had one problem. I got an incredible value when i bought the car as the Rendezvous was at the end of it's run. The styling hadn't changed much in the last few years but we liked the way it looked and the interior was very nice. What surprises me is that I consistently get 23 mpg on the highway. This is better than i get with my Nissan Murano which is much smaller??? In local driving i get around 16 which is painful when gas is $4+ a gallon but reasonable when you consider the size and 7 passenger capacity. I have 31,000 miles and am still going strong! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Highway Gas mileage and rear DVD entertainment system is great. Use the 7 passenger seating all the time. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2005 rendezvous. Pretty much the same, but much better gas mileage than the '07.With all the incentives offered, how could you not buy one? from $31,000 to $20,000 out the door. It is a Buick, comfortable ride, much beter quality than anything else out there for the money. It's to bad they opted to drop it in 2007, and rather than keep it and improve it, they come out with the enclave, a nice ride, but out of my price range. looking at the 2010 equinox. 32 mpg, i might have to trade the rendezvous in!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>GM used to mean quality in my family, but this car has been a complete disappointment. Since buying it in 2007 with 13k miles I've had to spend $6k more in repairs due to persistent inability of car to start including faulty wiring, axle and wheel train replacement of loose or prematurely broken parts, and a brake job. In the 11 years that I owned a subaru, I never had to do any more than change the oil. For this car I had to even subscribe to onstar for peace of mind because the car is so unreliable. Based on the quality of this car I can see how GM got themselves into thier current setuation. Let a free market economy rule!! I am headed back to the Subaru dealership for a new car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very nice ride. I bought the 07 CX with the luxury package with 27,000 miles for $13,900. I've put on 1,000 miles since I bought it. I think I got a great deal. Very smooth ride, I have to be careful on the highway because I don't notice when I'm speeding. My husband is 6'1" and has plenty of head room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 24k miles,one of the best cars we have owned. We had 2 good Chrysler vans. This CXL replaced a noisy, cheapo, gas-guzzler Honda Odyssey ?XL?- no luxury features even available! Liked a rented Rendezvous on Florida vacation. Later compared it to the Lexus SUV -cramped and boring. The Buick is larger inside and $20K cheaper. Quiet, luxurious, versatile and 22.5 mpg thrifty. Comforts of the car are on par with our Avalon sedan. 7 people can ride if needed & with the middle seats out, we carry 3 dogs and luggage for trips. It has been great in the snow even in our hilly neighborhood. Love the car. Sad that GM made the dumb decision to discontinue & replace it with a bulbous gas guzzler.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Luxury gizmos, comfortable seats, quiet, roomy, flexible interior. 100,000-mile warranty instills confidence and helps resale. OnStar navigation with integrated car phone is great feature. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving a friend's Lexus SUV I was not expecting much from this Buick. Surprise. We like it much better. Sure the dashboard is plain but we improved it by adding a wood grain kit. After 27,000+ miles our only real issue has been the radio which is junk. Three visits to the dealer have failed to have any effect. Gas mileage is incredibly poor for such a small V-6. We only get about 15mpg in town and 22 on the road. Our Impala with a similar engine gets at least 5mpg better. But, the Buick tows our small boat effortlessly, there is room galore with the seats folded and so far, it has been mechanically reliable. The 100,000 mile warranty inspires confidence.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Given that 2007 is the last year for this model, good off-lease and used examples can be a bargain. We purchased ours for $10,000 under original list price. While not a Lexus by any means, it is still half the price for similar comfort and capacity. Great warranty coverage. Our only real complaint is that the 3.5 engine could have been the 3.6 with better power and mileage. Also, the radio stinks. An aftermarket radio is in our future.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have been very unhappy with this vehicle. The fuel economy has been terrible, average 16 mpg with a mix of highway and city driving. My husband is 6'4 and when he is driving my children have no room for their legs in the back seat. A car seat is out of the question behind him. We have the split reclining middle row, not sure if this is why. But, my kids absolutely hate this car. Numerous problems, serviced the next day after purchase and should go in again but am to busy and because this is a lease I'm leaving with the noisy turns, poor gas mileage, poor leg room for children and the interior roof coming apart in the back. Rear seat belts end up under the folding seat, hard to get.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Afer having a baby, my husband and I knew that the Pontiac G6 that we owned was too small for a now family of 3. We looked and looked to find a SUV in our price range and found that all of the ones we were interested in were out of our range. We decided to take a look at roomier cars with the dealer that sold us our G6 and he informed us on a great buy with the Rendevous! We ended up paying roughly $30 more per month than what we were currently paying and got a roomier car all at once. The other little SUV's did not have nearly the space and were charging doulbe the price. We love our new car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded our trusty 2002 Impala on the Buick to get more room and pull our small boat trailer. So far so good. Stereo system is awful. Will have to replace it. Will not even stay on local stations. It did stall one time in traffic with no explanation. We're praying this does not happen again. But, for the money (we purchased an off-lease car) it still seems a bargain. Mileage averaging 20mpg overall, not bad for a vehicle of this size and weight.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the vehicle and have noticed that at low speed with the foot off the accelerator and then trying to accelerate again the vehicle does not engage immediately. I think the torque converter or accelerator (electronically controlled) is a problem. Love the styling, should have the trip computer (fuel economy reading, oil change time, etc,) as standard like on my Chevy 05 Malibu. Disappointed with the storage compartments in the rear and the fact the second row seats do not slide per the brochure. Milage about 22 around town is excellent, ride is fantastic, </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought our 3rd Rendezvous. Just couldn't find a better vehicle for 20K. Nothing comes close to the amount of car you get for the money. OnStar. Stainless exhaust. Galvanized metal, and seats that come out which makes more cargo room to haul things than any other SUV. I get 27 mpg on the highway and have gotten 28. Hard to find one now though. They are selling fast. My 2002 will need replaced just in time for me to buy a Chevy Volt unless Buick comes out with something to compete with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I fell in love with the style of the SUV. I went from a Vue to a Rendezvous, much much more roomier. Only problems are every time it rains, the water was running in through the dashboard. Got the driver side fixed but have been back twice for the passenger side. Also, battery light keeps coming on. Waiting to get that fixed. Passenger window cracked (factory defect) waiting for that part and the ceiling panel was hanging got that fixed. Still love the car but they should have made the driver seat more adjustable to move back further. Lots of room and comfy back seat that reclines. Would buy again but maybe have less of a water problem</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a loaded CX in February and now have about 3000 miles on it! My wife and I are very happy with the vehicle. It has a smooth and relatively quite ride and is enjoyable to drive. The vehicle has more than adequate acceleration for most situations. We seem to get about 19 to 20 mpg overall. My wife really liked the looks of the Nissan Murano but with a $1300 discount off the list price, $5200 in rebates and $3300 of GM card credit, the bang for the buck we got with the Rendezvous was light years ahead of the Murano! We couldn't be happier!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth, quiet and comfortable ride with good low end pep. The vehicle seems to be well made with good fit and finish and a nice interior. Four year 50,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. Sunroof. Value for the money spent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were looking to replace one of our SUV's with a vehicle that provided better gas mileage without sacrificing cargo capacity. My wife did not want a minivan or a car as a replacement. She enjoys the driving position that an SUV provides. Like most buyers, we initially looked at the offerings from the imports. Friends of ours went through the same process about a year ago and ended up buying a 2006 Rendezvous. Both he and his wife highly recommended it. After test driving a 2007 Rendezvous we became a believer. With the current rebate we ended up buying a fully loaded CXL for the price of a stripped down import. If ride, roominess and mileage are important consider the Rendezvous.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Buick's quiet tuning, excellent fit and finish, smooth ride, headroom and overall roominess, 2nd row folding, sliding and reclining seat, center console storage system, turn by turn navigation, $4,000 rebate, best warranty in the business-100,000 mile powertrain, 4yr/50,000 mi Buick bumper to bumper</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Why did I not notice this vehicle for so many years? When it came time to replace the mini van I was looking for something different, but something that still had a 3rd row and a reasonable price. By chance, I found out the Rendezvous did. Took it for a test drive and fell in love. I found it to be comfortable, very roomy, and fun to drive. A quick check on other reviews and consumer reports gave high marks. The rebate was great. Purchased it a week later. Very satisfied. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>3rd row option on CX, ample space, center storage areas/options, comfortable, sunroof, $4,000 rebate, an easy move from a mini van (an upgrade in some ways). Better gas mileage then most SUVs. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted something a little larger than the RAV4 and CR-V, but still easy to manuever into tight parking spaces. In addition to the extra room, the smooth and quiet ride sold me on the Rendezvous. The V6 engine has enough power for almost every situation. This mid-size SUV feels nimble driving in the city, but is very stable and comfortable on the highway. Body lean during cornering is well controlled. The standard rear back-up sensors are very helpful. With the 3rd row folding seat (optional on the CX), the ability to hold an occasional 7 people is a nice feature. Since Buick stopped advertising the Rendezvous some time ago, you should be able to get one at a great price like I did.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I almost leased a Honda mini van. The Buick has much nicer ride,handling, interior, radio, and its seating with the second row buckets is as good as the Honda all for a lower price. I'm very pleased with this vehicle in my first month. With the bumper to bumper of 48mo/50k mi and the 60mo/100k mi waranty my only concerns are resale as it will not be continued in '08. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun to drive and relaxing too. My wife loves being up above the traffic so she can see well in her trip to work and for her many trips on the Garden State Parkway. We did not want a 3rd seat and its great that Buick offers that option. It gives us more storage room. Love having dials and switches that we can actually read vs a "symbol". I own a LaSabre and really like Buick's quality. I am very, very dissapointed that they are discontiuing this car. I think they should have advertised this more. Oh well, we are very happy to own the Rendezvous and think others would also.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The spare tire is impossible to put back once taken from under the auto. The spare hangs by a crank cable system similar to other GM SUVs. However, directly under the spare is both a suspension strut and a part of the frame. So the tire is in a small keyhole. I used the spare and could not get it back into the keyhole. My neighbor and I by laying on the ground under the car were able to push and pull the spare back into the key hole. They should make every GM engineer who designed this do it every day.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Shocked</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>We were absolutely shocked to learn that this vehicle is the only GM vehicle (including all other Buick models) that includes rear seat seatbelts that do not "lock" unless or until it becomes necessary. Subsequently, small children have the ability to "hang" and "dangle" from the seatbelts. Should the seatbelts reliably "lock" when needed (not proven), children are at risk for severe injury if they are not sitting upright or if the belt literally "snaps" them backwards. Utterly ridiculous and absolutely unsafe for children. We returned our vehicle within days of taking delivery. All research indicates that even the slightest slack in the belt increases substantially the risk of head/neck injury</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Any "positive" about this vehicle was negated by the complete lack of safety for my children. I cannot believe that Buick/GM would take this risk and it is inconceivable why this feature would only be in the Rendezvous!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am an owner of a BMW M5 and an Audi S4. But I needed a vehicle with genuine luggage capacity for a vacation. I rented a Rendezvous CXL. I really liked it. My wife really liked it. Even our college-bound son admitted he liked it.The Rendezvous offered very comfortable seats and comfortable ride, quiet and reasonable horsepower, though I always would like more. It provides a great view and command of the highway and there was no difficulty in handling city driving. I had been considering the purchase of a BMW X5 as an SUV but I am now seriously considering a Rendezvous CXL, or Buick?s successor to the Rendezvous, the Enclave. Congratulations to a fine American car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Buick is a step ahead of other competitors, even with GM. I got the CX with all the options available on it. I like the CX because the exterior mirrors are shiny black. The CXL uses body color. I leased this car and was very surprised. It is a luxury SUV with an msrp of $30,000. I leased it for under $400 sign and drive. I have never driven a car that is so refined and drives so smoothly. Another thing going for it is the standard rear park assist. It really helps avoid accidents. Most luxury cars like Benz don't even offer it standard. I can't live without OnStar anymore. I always forget my cell, but I dont need to worry anymore. Leaving my keys in car is a problem too, but no worries anymore. It has features that only the Americans can think of like comfort level and huge compartments. The second row has 2 center pieces that fold away. That means that this car is really wide. It is going to last a long time, will buy again</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The level of comfort is unsurpassed. It is the midsize SUV with the most cargo capacity. It also has a very comfortable 3rd row. I love the auto lights with daytime running, the wood on steering wheel, the color. It is a heavy car with a refined 6cyl that does 26 mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one of the best handling cars that I have ever owned. The Rendezvous CXL is very comfortable when driving in town or out on the highway. The heads-up display keeps your eyes on the road and not looking down to set your cruise. The instrument panel is laid out to see your gauges, but are also shown in the heads-up display. My wife drove a Buick LaCrosse, but to her the Rendezvous gives her a comfortable ride and the ease of driving a small car in traffic, but doesn't feel like a full size SUV. It's very nicely equipped and for the money it's a good car to own. I read some of the reviews on the 2005 & 2006 Rendezvous, I feel like a lot of the complaints have been fixed on the 2007 model.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The leather w/suede powered driver w/memory and passenger seats are nice because my wife uses one setting and I use the other to move the seat. We like the heated seats, the sunroof, 6 CD changer, large heated outside mirrors that tilt down when backing up, and the warning sensors on the rear bumper</FAVORITE>
