<TEXT>Yes the Kia is very comfortable and has lots of nice gadgets, the kia does drive well and gains speed pretty quickly, aside from that I have had more of a headache with it then what it is worth: I have had to take my KIA in 3 times already within 2 months time. The power sliding doors do not open so I have to manually pull them open, my Kia will start only when IT wants to! First I was told it was the junction box that needed to be replaced and now it is supposedly the "body control module" that now needs to be replaced. As a mother with four children I am very busy with school, sports, work, etc. I absolutely need a reliable form of transportation this van is NOT reliable! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Unlike other reviews, I have put over 80000 miles on my Sedona in just 2 years. So, I'm talking experience here. The car handles like a sports car. The ride is pretty good, although there is no isulation to speak of (you hear a lot of road noise). I get 20 mpg in city/highway driving. On the open road, at 75, I get 24-25. Great bang for the buck! Downside! The residual value on this vehicle is horrible. Comparing it to other minivans with comparable equipment, mileage, and initial purchase cost, the Kia is $4k-5k less. I trade every 2 years, and expect to pay to get right side up. However, this van is costing me too much to trade. Cost new; $24k. Now; $6500! What a hit in 2 years!</TEXT>

<TEXT>07 EX with power package (power sliding doors $ liftgate.) We initially wanted an Odessey, but after driving both we went with the Kia becuase of the warranty and price, (A similarly equipped honda was $7K more.)and couldn't be happier. It's has a powerful V6 with a smooth shifting trans and handles well for the weight of the vehicle.(4600lbs.) Fuel economy is outstanding on the highway (24-28 mpg)though it suffers in city driving. 14-17 depending on traffic) I wish we would have opted for the DVD system for the kids. This is a great family vehicle! The only complaint I have is at 20000 miles it has developed a few rattles in the back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a courier so I put a lot of miles on in a short time. I have had to replace the brakes 3 times in less than one year. The first time because one of the brake pads just fell off the vehicle! It now has 66,000 miles and I am already having to replace the rotors and the brakes again. Very poor quality in the brakes! Service engine light came on once already and had to be taken in for that. That time was the solenoid. Now it's on again and will have to be taken in again to be fixed. Don't know yet what that problem is. And come on.. do you really need 12 cup holders in a vehicle that seats 7 only?!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable to drive. Very quiet. Feels like you are floating on air. Be careful or your speed gets away from you because of that. Side doors windows roll down. Very nice feature! Lots of nooks and crannies.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove the Honda, Toyota,and Nissan. The Sedona was always near or at the top of every test I put it through. At roughly 8k less than the others fully loaded it was an easy decision. To this point I have no regrets. The van does everything it needs to do, it does it safely and I would say it's the best family vehicle on the road. For those who value safety the Sedona has the best crash test rating ever for a minivan and has all the active safety equipment standard. For a vehicle this size fuel economy is decent, and power is plentiful.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Sedona is a dream come true. We priced and researched minivans and were drawn into the Kia dealership by their price and warranty. We did not expect quality too. The van has been dependable, roomy, and great on gas on road trips. Our Sedona has been loaded with adults and children alike. We always get compliments on the room and comfort for all passengers. The LWB (long wheel base) model offers that extra foot you may need on a road trip. It is nice to take a vehicle that has room for everything and the kitchen sink. I always have room for my stroller, groceries and passengers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The extra room in the LWB model. The fold away third row. The power doors. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2007 Sedona (20K miles) about 6 months ago and would do it again. I would have had to buy a 5 year old Honda or Toyota to get the price I did. I bought this thing because I heard kids prone to car sickness do well in minivans. And my 3 year old used to vomit on any trip over about 30m. Well, it worked. The kid doesn't vomit on trips anymore. The vehicle really has a nice ride to it. I am fairly impressed with this vehicle as far as value for the money. My kids call it Daddy's truck and I don't really feel like telling them that it's a minivan. On the other hand I am not embarrassed because I have another vehicle that is the opposite of a minivan. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1.) Kid doesn't vomit on long trips anymore. 2.) I admit I like the sliding doors. IT makes it easy with kids. 3.) Seating for 6 and the ability to stow the third row. 4.) Value for the money.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Leased 2007 Sedona July 2007. 1 week later needed the DVD replaced. Power sliding doors decided to work or not when they felt like it and don't always close securely, sometimes opening back up for no reason and often hearing a crunching sound also. Fuse box needed replaced, no wipers. Tire pressure system often shows all tires are low for no reason. Sunroof leaks. DVD blocks rear mirror when driver's seat is raised. Driver needs to be a contortionist to operate and remove dvds for small children while driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The van is reliable and easy to drive. The comfort level is very good. In the first 25,000 miles I had to replace both brakes and tires. My biggest complaint is that gas mileage doesn't exist. Highway is fine at about 19/20 to the gallon but city is around 10 and they can do nothing about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned 2 Ford Windstars, tired of constant mechanical issues. Did a lot of research before i brought the Sedona EX. After 7 months of owning the Sedona Ex best can still say its a great vehicle. Sedona is extremely solid, we have the ex w/ leather and entertainment pack.interior materials are of good quality, extremely roomy, great storage. I love the sunroof, and side windows that go down. Transmission is very smooth. Gas mileage has been combined 22 mpg. I love driving this van, feels like your driving a luxury vehicle. Has a lot of pep for a minivan (245 HP).Quality is right up there with Honda and Toy. You won't be disappointed. Great warranty, highest safety ratings, great price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety features,sunroof, and functional side windows, DVD, great infinity stereo, sports tranny,10 yr warranty, leather int, excellent . storage, power doors, The van is nicely put together- exterior panels fit well, paint if far nicer than my new Honda.

<TEXT>We bought this car under pressure. The old Nissan Quest was on it's last legs (HATED that car!), and we needed something quick. We looked at the Dodge Grand Caravan and it wasn't all that. We looked at an '08 Sedona LX and really liked it, then we noticed a leftover '07 EX on the lot and took it for a drive. Immediate infatuation! I really love driving this car! It's comfortable, has all the features we wanted (but didn't think we could afford) and the price was right. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We are a retired couple and were planning to purchase a van as a utilitarian vehicle to haul stuff from home improvement stores, pull a trailer, and take our grandkids to various events. We also owned a 1998 Toyota Avalon that we planned to keep for longer trips and as our "going out" car. We spent nearly six months comparing vans on this website and on safecarguide, and then driving them. Safety and value were very important to us. We decided to purchase a new Kia Sedona. Not only did it cost less than some late model used vans at Carmax, but the warranty and roadside assistance gave us assurance that the manufacturer was standing behind the sale. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This van is comfortable and fun to drive. In fact, after we drove from Charlotte to Washington, DC, with a couple of passengers last November, we decided we no longer needed a second car and sold our Avalon in January. We like the responsive engine, and the many compartments (like a double glovebox)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a fun car to drive. At today's gas prices, I am glad to report that the car actually gets the advertised mileage. They stated it would get 18 mpg (city) and 25 mpg (highway). While mileage depends on driving habits, I get at least 18 mpg city, and up to 28 mpg highway. The 28 mpg was reached while driving on an interstate doing 85 mph (don't tell the police.)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This van is fully loaded-plus, we added on a combo navigation/rear camera system, expensive, but worth it! Car has plenty of power, and transmission is smooth stock tires are adequate, but I will eventually replace them with ultimate quality tires. It's quiet at all speeds. A great plus is the headlights, which light up the road at night like monster floodlights. An important safety advance, in our opinion. We traded in an Odyssey ex- l, and we do not regret it, although, overall, the Kia is not quite as sumptuous as the Odyssey was. But, the price differential was too great to ignore (about $6000 less, comparably equipped). Ergonomics are first-rate; even the sun-roof works easily!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote button to open the back liftgate, automatic seat positioning, with two memory settings for the driver, cup holders are actually deep enough to prevent spills.

<TEXT>My wife and I were looking to replace our 10 year old minivan. We started out with Honda and Toyota and of course we liked what we saw but the price was excessive. I parked next to a Sedona the next day, looked inside and was impressed. I went to look at one the next day and I just couldn't believe it. More features, better warranty and significantly less money. Full power, 3 zone air, front to back air bags, memory seats, side mirrors automatically adjust down when backing to improve vision. Too many features to mention. For a change, we did not feel like we were taken advantage of. Love it!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a '05 Impala for this vehicle and I don't feel as if I sacrificed anything by purchasing it. I have the same amount of power with my KIA as I had with the Impala. It's GREAT! Who would have thought a minivan with 250 horses? I can roast the tires if I'm not careful! Comfortable and very stable ride. When I first purchased it, I found myself driving it like a sports sedan. And the best thing is that the vehicle will allow you to do that. The suspension and traction control will keep you stable when dodging the occasional idiot driver. The fold flat rear seats are awesome and the sliding doors have power windows! Great Van! Can't wait to see the next set of improvements!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased a 07 Sedona left-over. The Kia is more than I expected. The overall quality is very good. Looked at JD Power - rates Sedona higher than Honda Odyssey. The ride is very quiet, handling is great for a large car. The Sedona weighs in at 4600 lbs. I was very impressed at the pick-up. The Sedona has a Punch when you step on the accelerator. Also the storage behind the 3rd row seats is very large. We used to need a car Carrier on our windstar to haul all of our luggage. That's not going to be the case with the Sedona. The Sedona is all luxury, I can't get over how quiet and smooth the ride is. Plus your driving one of the safest vehicles on the road. Plenty of interior storage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard Safety features, sunroof, side-windows come down (great touch KIA), plenty of storage, memory seating positions for drivers, leather w/heated seats, adjustable pedals, wireless head phones for DVD player, easy to move seats around, very room, best feature- the VALUE.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I test drove this vehicle I couldn't believe how smooth and quiet the drive was, very surprising for a minivan. The interior is very roomy and comfortable, you can stretch out and really relax. The 2nd row seating is very comfortable. I got this van because I needed more room for my grandbabies, and it really gives me the room that I needed, plus the comfort. It has a lot of power, it can get up and go when you need it to. I love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the fold down tray in between the driver and front passenger seats, very handy. The glove boxes, there are 2 and they are roomy. But I really love the two rear windows, they roll down, I have never seen this feature in a van before. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle. It has the best crash rating out of all of the minivans. I love how it handles. The warranty is by far the best. It comes with all of the bells and whistles as the other minivans, But a little cheaper. Gas mileage is great. I have 5 kids, so the ease of getting in and out is amazing.

<TEXT>I am shooting myself in the foot by giving this van a poor review, but so far, I have to have the air conditioner compressor worked on, the sliding passenger door scrapes, the steering wheel whooshes when you make a turn, the transmission clunks when shifting into drive, my driver's seat squeaks and juts forward, the ignition has locked on me four times in the past three days, there are blind spots in the wind shield pillars and when using the visors, it bottoms out on bumps and sways on cornering the airconditioning has a musty smell, the mileage is much less than promised, and the KIA dealership tried to rip me off on the service agreement. Now other than that, things are just fine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Family likes the DVD player. Ability to roll down 2nd row windows. Heated front seats. Remote sliding doors & liftgate. Radio volume can be controlled from the steering wheel. Price was good for a car with all of these features, but the reliabilty is poor. Adjustable foot pedals. Lots of airbags. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I chose the Kia minivan over several others I test drove. It has a nice driving feel to it. It looks nice as far as minivans go, and it has a good warranty. It's a good value for the money when you throw in the 100,000 warranty. I was very disappointed when the transmission locked in park and it stranded my three young kids and me thirty miles from home. Unfortunately KIA agreed to tow the car to the dealership but didn't offer to provide us with a ride home or contact a rental car company. Kia's slogan is "The power to surprise." They got that right. I was surprised that a car would break down after only six weeks and 3,600 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 5 year old Chevy Venture for a new 2007 Kia Sedona EX with all options. I have not been disappointed. This van rides quiet and feels extremely solid on the road. Powerful and smooth. The build quality is excellent. Fit and finish are superb. Fuel economy has been much better than expected. Averaging around 20.5 MPG combined city/hwy and got 23.3 mpg on vacation this summer. Not bad when you consider 75 mph with four people and a weeks' worth of luggage. Changed the oil myself. Very easy to do since the oil filter is located on the top of the engine. I highly recommend this van.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power liftgate is very handy. I love everything about this van. I love all the built in safety features. Feel very safe driving at night in a downpour - solid vehicle that feels solidly planted on the road. Auto dimming DVD screen is very nice. Chevy did not do that.</FAVORITE>

I have had this vehicle for 4 months and I already have 13,000 miles on it. I take my Sedona everywhere. This vehicle is perfect for traveling. I love the large space behind the 3rd row when the 3rd row is up. Driving the Sedona is definitely fun and a pleasure. It has plenty of pickup and a very comfortable ride. Took it on a 2,000 mile road trip and averaged 25 miles per gallon. I would definitely recomend this vehicle to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a 2004 Kia Sedona largely on price and figured with a 100K warranty if it was junk KIA would have to fix it. We found it to be a very reliable, stable and flexable vehicle that could do about anything we ask. On July 2, 2007 we were hit in the passenger side and pushed into a pole. The van was totalled but my wife and I walked away with only a broken nose and bruises. The fire and ambulance crew were afraid we would be dead when they saw the van. We believe in Kia safety and purchased a brand new one immediately. We love and trust our Kia minivan. I would recommend it to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I looked at almost every van on the market and for the money the Kia was by far the best performing, best handling, best riding van out of them all. The Sienna had a few options the Kia did not that we liked but it was not worth the extra money.

<TEXT>This is the first minivan I've really liked, very well thought out. With 10K on the odometer we've had no problems. Recommend comparing the Sedona directly with an Odyssey EXL or Touring and you'll probably find the Sedona a much better buy in terms of included features, safety, warranty and most of all price. Built on the same assembly line, the Sedona is basically a Hyundai Entourage with a simpler option package for a few thousand dollars less. Comfortable flip-forward middle seats make more sense than stow-and-go for us, plus you get more ground clearance. Love the euro-styling, 17" alloy wheels, Michelin tires and sport shifter.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine from the Hyundai Azera. Powerful, simple, timing chain driven, should prove reliable and low maintenance. Smooth five speed transmission.

<TEXT>This van wasn't on my list of vehicles to purchase. However after reading the reviews and taking many different test drives, I really began to appreciate this van. The engine performs well. The dash and controls are fantastic. Exterior design is very nice. And to top it off the price tag is fairly reasonable. Anyone wishing to purchase the Odyssey or the Sienna really are doing themselves a disservice if they don't at least test drive the Sedona first. They will come to the same conclusion that I came to and manage to keep a few bucks in your pocket.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After comparing this to Honda, Toyota and Dodge, the Kia Sedona was a no-brainer. I find the styling of the Kia more attractive and SUV-like. The performance is outstanding for a minivan. The warranty was a big factor in our purchase decision, but I believe the build quality is close to if not equal to Toyota and Honda. What sealed the deal though is that by far and away the Kia gives you the most for your money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We test drove an Odyssey, Sienna and the Sedona, and the Sedona is equal or better than the other 2. We were very disappointed with the Sienna fit and finish. The Sedona is a excellent van, with very good power, comfort, road manners and price (the Sedona is not cheap as it used to be but this model is far superior than the older design). My gas mileage in the city is around 16 and 26 in the highway, I am pleased with the fuel economy, I know it will improve when the engine breaks in. We really enjoy driving this car, my children love the comfort and the DVD.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased short wheel based version. Noticed that it suffers for fuel mileage, but makes up for it in cargo, and convenience. I travel, and got rid of a 2003 Ford Taurus, which got excellent mileage, and had 140,000 miles. But I am retired and needed the cargo capacity and leg room.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the visibility, and the rear door inside handle. I am a disabled vet, and can still easily remove the seats and roll them into storage when needed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Road tested on inner city streets and on highways. Very comfortable feeling and handles very well on turns and curves. Like sitting on my couch driving through winding roads. Love everything about this model. Maybe a little too long for my garage, but other than that, an excellent overall vehicle. Also, the rear backing sensors are great, along with the child monitoring reflector mirror.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Memory seating positions for driver and adjustable brake and accelerator pedals. Captain's chair in middle row. Third row fully collapses flat. Power side doors, and hatch. Three independent temperature control zones. My daughters love the DVD player and the middle aisle (she calls it the walk-way).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I compared ALL vans. It came down to the Honda and yes, the Kia. Honda if you want to lease... Kia to buy. Though I preferred the Honda, the $3k difference, bang for the buck, 10 year warranty, a better reliability rating by Consumer Reports, BEST minivan distinction in safety by the insurance institute, 5 star gov. rating, "Best Buy" by Consumers Digest and on and on from one review to the next...decision done. I did like the drive of the Honda, but I believe it's because of the name cache "Honda" vs. Kia. Getting over that, they drive near identical. The fit and finish is also on par, if not better. Common sense, value, and the safest van distinction made this an easy purchase. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power sliding doors and rear hatch. Fold flat split sliding chairs. Air bag canopy. Seating position, comfort and dual power seats. Tons of cupholders. Tri-zone AC. VERY powerful engine. Better grade fabric than Honda. NO RATTLES or SQUEAKING unlike other new cars I've owed with as much miles. </FAVORITE>
