<TEXT>If you are looking for a slightly used cross over, I highly recommend the Dodge Magnum instead. First Dodge I've owned, and I love it! Fantastic alternative to those boring CUVs. I drove Jeeps for 12 years (last 3 was a Commander), and wanted something better on gas, but more fun on the road. The Magnum has a deeper cargo area than our Nissan Murano ('07 SL), costs less, and is 100% more fun to drive. My wife discovered this, too and now I have to hide the keys to the Magnum. My daughter is 3, but already demands "HEMI". RT package is excellent, the torque from the HEMI is intense, but refined and smooth at normal speeds. Visibility is perfect with an aftermarket rear view mirror.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Totally unique. Reminds me of an old school muscle car. Incredible power and handling given the weight. Smooth ride, but not a floating couch like a full size SUV. I'm 6'3" and can't believe the passenger room. It handles as well as my '01 Maxima did, but is larger, more stable and a bit faster!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've already put 50000 miles on this awesome machine, and it still drives like it's brand new. My dogs like the cargo space, my family loves the ample leather space inside. I feel like this car is just going to go on forever, like an old pickup truck would. I think the hemi, and the heavy duty transmission are unstoppable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very solid feel. Excellent on bad weather. Safety of a wagon for my children, yet still has muscle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I worked @ the dealership for 14mos. and drove all models available from SE to SRT. The 2.7L V6 in the SE just isn't powerful enough for a 4000 lb car, especially in steep climbs, and it dosen't have ESP like the SXT and higher models. I purchased my SXT, because the 3.5 L V6 has a very good track record of reliability and I could not afford the RT at the time. If you can afford the RT, GET IT instead of the SXT! If you can't, the SXT has most of the base features the RT has, including the 5 speed autostick trans. Use a high grade motor oil, I use CASTROL GTX or SYNTEC and have noticed an increased gas mileage of almost 5 mi./ gal. Some recalls exist, get them executed ASAP! Nice car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance and handling, especially with Electronic Stability Program in bad weather. ESP is designed to turn off the cruise control and cut down on the throttle if the driver is going too fast in a really bad weather situation. I'm sure it has already saved my life twice! It's fun, and safe!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Station Wagon on steroid, fun to drive with enough power on Hwy and city. Very good AWD. But.... I had to bring the vehicle twice to Dodge for engine failure. First time one of my valve broke, second time, the engine stall, the warning light stays on and ... still waiting for teh results. Not a reliable car </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was a 4wd driver for over 20yrs and decided because I live closer to work now and mileage is more of a concern I traded my 2005 silverado with all the toys and whistles in on my magnum. It handles like a dream. I have already gotten my very first speeding ticket (at age 51) as it goes quick a little too easy. I am not used to a lower profile and taking curves in the road is fun but it is great and the mileage is great too. The interior is a little lacking on mine but I don't spend that much time in it so it isn't a big deal. The stereo is better than I thought and it seems to be reliable so far. Over all I like my "car". </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Greatest feature besides looking snooty is the way it curves, I just can't get enuf of going around bends in the road and where I live there are plenty. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned a lot of cars from muscle cars to high-end european and this car is the absolute best buy ever. The performance, handling, looks and capacity are all incredible for the price (paid $25K with 8000 miles on it). I have spent many hours driving over mountain passes and interstates in horrible winter weather and this baby is rock solid. Maybe it's the Mercedes all wheel drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Best car I have ever owned. The looks, the interior space and enough whip for V8 models and up! Good gas mileage for 340hp ( getting 19-20) Could have gotten better quality interior but very quiet and comfortable inside. Drove to NC and handled awesome around mountain roads. I test drove v6 and there is a big drop off ! Go Hemi, the best route to go.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big and fast , love computer control on steering wheel!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I own a 1969 Superbee, 1971 Cuda, & a 1981 Corvette and I have as much fun and more comfort in the Magnum as I do in all of the other cars I own. If you are looking for a car, I would highly recommend the Magnum. Dodge has discontinued this car which I think is very foolish.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leg room and the exterior look of the Magnum. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is very clean cut and has an aggressive look which I like. The horsepower sucks and wish I got the hemi model for that reason. Space and comfort is great though. Gas mileage stinks and I don't have a heavy foot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a used 07 after renting an 08. Mine is 3.5L RWD, Inferno Red Pearl. BEE...UTIFUL!!! All leather and great stock stereo. Lots of space for my 3 tall teens. Awesome styling, very different from anything out there. A modern muscle car regardless of engine size. Joined a Magnum owners club last night and can't wait to cruise with all you Muscle Mag owners out there! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very attractive body style! My RT has 18s, nothing special, but I do plan on getting better performance tires and wheels after my first year with the car (8.08). Agree with some of the past comments about interior design, could've done better, especially that cruise control stick on the left. Had to add Navigational/6-CD, and BlueTooth for convenience; could use audio controls on the steering wheel (another option = $$). Blind spots can be trick at times, but when driving defensively, not that big of a problem! But still a problem. Brakes now beginning to squeak at 10K, need to have them checked out at next service.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite: the 5.7L Hemi! Good acceleration when needed. Comfortable ride on short and long trips. Driving to Vegas from L.A. was a breeze. Gas mileage was just O.K., but now at almost $4/gallon, driving becomes more expensive in this car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great Ride! Fun to drive. I got the SXT with leather, sun roof (huge opening), 3.5L V6. The 3.5 liter has great performance for the size of the ride. I think the 2.7L would be too small but just an opinion. Love the smooth ride (a lot of people don't know most of the suspension parts are Mercedes Benz). HUGE amount of cargo space in the back. And has a lot of great standard features. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an SUV type cabin but a luxury type of ride. Cons: Cruise Control Stick design takes getting used to. Some blind spots on the sides of wind shield. Parking is kind of tough since its a long ride. A lot of backing out and straightening to get into spaces.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun car to drive. I installed a Jet chip to even out the sluggish starts. I can't complain, though it is only a V6 (3.5L) and not a Hemi. The chip worked nicely. Next is a K&N Air intake, cheap ways to gain a few more ponies.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Black on Black, just a good looking car. I'd like to add is the chopped roof is suppose to be that way, it's not Gangster, it's the look of a Hot Rod. if you want better visibility you should consider a Subaru wagon. Not a knock on Subaru...just a thought.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Every time I see my car I can't believe how good it looks. @hat a beautiful, fun to drive vehicle it is. I wouldn't mind having one of the bigger engines, however I enjoy the gas mileage and can't complain about power or acceleration. Overall I'm very satisfied with my car, it gets me from point a to point b in style and comfort.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the quietness of the ride best. The tilt steering wheel is great and the stereo sound is surprising. Even though it's just a 2.7 engine, it has that little throaty growl when you put your foot into it a little!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had to decide what kind of car I was gonna get. I was more than surprised to realise that I was going to be buying an American Car (that wasn't a Jeep). After owning 3 BMW's, I was sure a European car would be sitting in the driveway but wow. The Magnum has been a favorite design since they hit the streets. After driving it, the handling, the fit and finish, the interior, the solid feel of well thought out construction, and most importantly, the way I feel when I'm driving this car. How did Dodge manage to keep the vehicle so tame and peaceful on the inside. It kinda feels like a Mercedes... OK, maybe it is the Daimler influence on Dodge.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the dash layout and the fold down rear seats. Believe it or not, the interior space is far more than my Jeep Wrangler. I cannot believe how much cargo space I now have. Oh yea, the sound system is amazing. It's without a doubt, the best sound system I've heard in a car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice comfortable car with lousy windows and mediocre controls. What were they thinking? Hard to see stoplights, tops of hills etc. through narrow low windshield, the back has a narrow slit that gets dirty fast and is hard to see much in the rear either. Only question was where to mount the machine gun in the bunker. The cruise control, trip odometer are poorly located and designed, who needs an extra left handed stalk that runs right across the gas gauge. Did you hit the turn signal or the cruise control? Bad design. Controls and instruments have been much better designed in nearly all cars for over 50 years. Styling just to be different just dosen't cut it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine was quiet and responsive, the 5 speed A/T with its upshift and downshift controls were well designed and worked well going uphill and down hill in the mountains of Colorado. Highway mileage averaged over 26 mpg--just as advertised. Keep engine and transmission replace rest.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We recently took a 2300 mile trip in the car with four people and full of luggage, no problems. Ran great, average 20.9 mpg, even with a few high speed bursts.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The side view is the best, and being black. Besides the great performance, it attracts as much attention a my street rod.</FAVORITE>
