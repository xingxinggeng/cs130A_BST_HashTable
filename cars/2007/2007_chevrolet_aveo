<AUTHOR>good so far, but....</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Reliable (inc. all the way down to - 10F no issue). Not sporty (understeer), or sexy, but a very functional commuter. Inexpensive/easy to maintain, great on gas (35mpg at 80mph), BUT at 30 000, was getting 'bucking' cold (about 40F outside) when slowing at stop signs, and bucking when cold at 30mph (with flashing check engine light) - deayler confirmed valve issue (to be fixed under warranty). Synthetic oil since I got it didn't save it from this defect. Also had belt tensionner issues and rotor vibration (turning the rotors fixed that). Otherwise, I do like the car, and the service is friendly/trustworthy (they are throwing in a new Timing belt install)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Solidly built. good brakes. Very solid auto transmission (Aisin Warner), great city mileage, good storage. Great features (cabin air filter, sunglass holder, mp3 player). with winter tires, handles great in the snow. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle brand new as my first car two years ago. Since then, I replaced four tires, brakes, battery and now my alternator is gone out. And luckily for GM after the bumper to bumper warranty. No one can explain to me other then mileage why this car is failing me. No harsh driving just work was far and assisting others in the home with their daily routine. No help for anything but has overpriced for all services. Complaints or concerns are never heard and no offer of extended warranty to help ease the cost. From this point I have lost all faith in GM, and have decided that I would not buy Chevy ever again. GM fix this problem and maybe your problem will be fixed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Aveo has 63,000 miles. We purchased it as a small reliable car for our son who is in college. The car isn't what was promised. The radio comes on when the weather is damp or when it rains. The airbag sensor is on and one corner of the airbag cover came off. We have had problems with the horn blowing and the interior lights. The recall concerning the fuel pump running in a front end collision has us concerned too. After 4 calls GMC is finally working with us. We will not buy another one. </TEXT>

I had my vehicle serviced by another autoshop since I relocated. What a great headache. Avoid this Chevrolet aveo sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 2007 Aveo 5 door hatch back LS with automatic trans and air conditioning for my 16 year old daughter. That was 2 and a half years and 30,000 miles ago. Its been a great little car ! No problems at all and gets great gas mileage. This was the perfect car for my daughter to learn how to drive. Its easy to drive, has great visibility and very good safety features like side impact air bags with good crash test ratings. I guy at work has the same car but with a manual transmission and he swears he is getting 40 MPG ! What do people expect from a $12,000 car ? Its a great value. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Only my 3rd vehicle(all Chevy) to never have a problem. Put 62000 miles in 54 weeks on this car. changed tires at 45000 miles. Been a surprise as to driving. Due to my financial problems sold 3 Mercedes ,sl55,s55,cl55 and a 2007 corvette. Very surprised the performance and seats did not bother me after coming out of my prior vehicles. Was very bad and only changed oil 1 time and never went in for normal service. oil level never went down even after long quick trips. Gad millage at 85 was 27-29.5. Wind can push this car very easy and had occasionally caused the steering wheel to be knocked out of my hand. Breaks squeaked a lot in the morning</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the price that I paid, this car was a bargain. I know it's for transportation, but this car is incredibly fun to drive. I've put over 8000 mi on it so far and I've found it to be very comfortable even for 8 hour drives. It also has been averaging 32mpg on my way from Boston to DC so I've also been saving up to 80 dollars round trip, which is incredible. All in all, it has lots of space, room for 5 (reasonably comfortable), it's great on gas, and it gets you place to place with a 100000mi warranty for 11,000. Money well spent. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car does what you expect it to do - save money at the pump for a reasonably priced car. I owned it for 31,500 miles (almost 2 years-before I crashed it). My only complaint was that the front tires wore down after 22,000 miles, and the seats could be more comfortable. Other than that, the car pays for itself by laughing at gas pumps. Bought it as a commuter car going 60 miles a day, and never got less than 26 mpg city. Highway got 32~33 mpg easy. I crashed it recently, and the front collapsed well like an accordian- and I walked away without a scratch.I am 6'3 tall and fit well inside. Solid car for the price. Trunk is big,"hold" traction button puts car into lower gear for torque traction</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the 4 door sedan. Never had a problem. Took the car over from my daughter who moved to Chicago and didn't need a car. It would have never have been a car I would have bought. It tuned out to be a very pleasant suprise. The fuel mileage has been great and the room inside is unbelivable. We had 5 adults in the car and I am 6'4. I put really good tires on it and it runs at 80 mph on the highway with no problem. Easy to park. I take it from Detroit to Chicago twice a month (4.5 hour drive) and it's comfortable. I wouldn't want to take it across the country but I'm old and like big cars. Great car for the money, 3 of my neighbors have bought them since I got mine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my brand new black LT 4 door with all options except sunroof, leather and steering wheel audio controls. I checked around and it was the least expensive car with the options I wanted. I needed a more fuel economical car being that I commute 150 miles round trip a day, for four days. My 11 mpg (highway) Ford Explorer, V8, All Wheel Drive was killing me at the pump. (I still love my truck). I put the car to the test as soon as I got it. I had a custom made tow hitch installed to pull a mini tear drop cargo trailer and drove to Houston Texas. She was loaded with 3 adults and pulling a loaded mini trailer. She didn't miss a beat. Mind you the car is cheesy. You get what you pay for. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good handling, bright head lights and fog lights. Side marker/signal lights are a good safety feature. Plenty headroom (I'm 6'2'' 200lbs), good tires, exterior design is nice, easy to change oil yourself (oil filter front and centered) good brakes. I gotta say, car has the best bang for the buck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got a night work shift so I can catch the bus now after driving days for three months. Everything I expect from a $10,000 car with a $2,000 rebate, and another $1,000. from charging groceries on my GM mastercard credit card points. This Korean made car has a 1.6 liter engine to handle the load from the A/C. Since the Special Value doesn't have A/C, it has a lot of power. I drive 95% freeway and get 37 MPG. Same as a Cavalier with a larger motor. Seating is OK. Not plush. What else can I say about a basic car? Will buy another one in three years.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Probably the only car sold out there that is so basic with that allows me to skip the useless options. Buy a basic car every three years without losing money from depreciation.

<TEXT>6,500 miles - in for repair 4 times. 1 - bad light relay 2 - would not accelerate, bad throttle body 3 - overheating and no air conditioner, told it was low on anti-freeze. 4 - engine is bad. Knocked loudly from cam shaft. We are still waiting for a short block and head. This averages out to less than 2,000 miles per repair. The dealer has been Nice and Chevy is paying for a rental, but what a pain for a new car. And we bought a new so we wouldn't have to deal with this sort of thing. We are highly disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is cheap, but that says a lot for the quality of the vehicle. At 3000 miles, the windshield cracked....manufacturer defect. At 13000 miles, lost all my oil, which the oil light never came on...currently in the shop having the seals and gaskets in the engine replaced...might as well replace the whole engine. I bought this car for the gas mileage. Averaging about 28 miles per gallon on highway, and about 25 with the air conditioner on. Not good! The car shakes like it needs to be aligned, which I did and also had new, high quality tires put on and it still shakes terribly. I am truly scared to drive this car in high wind and rain. Hydroplanes bad! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my '07 Aveo in October (4,649 Miles and tagged at $11,000). The vehicle does really good in city driving, but leaves something to be desired at highway speeds. I own the manual transmission and had to upgrade with an aftermarket intake just to feel like I was moving faster then a stagecoach. All in all, the car is fairly "stable" once you reach your goal speed (as long as it isn't windy) but takes a long time to accelerate even when you lean on the higher RPM's. And it would be a good car for the price if you don't care about looks or horse's thanks to the the MPG and dependability factor. But that's all it has going for it to be honest. My opinion is buy another vehicle like the Cobalt.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this based on Chevy's reputation. At 4000 miles the generator and fuse box fried. At 30000 the AC went, and the dealer seems unable to locate another one. When they find one they are going to have to special order seals. The front end will not stay aligned and the car is too noisy, especially in a wind. The standard transmission feels like it is grinding. The car is roomy and fun to drive, but it is not well built. My suggestion is to look at other sub-compacts.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is plenty of room in the front, although the seats could be more comfortable for longer legged people. The styling is similar to many others on the road now, and can be made to look pretty sporty. The worst drawback is the mileage. I drive 40 mises a day,35 of it no the freeway, and it averages 31 MPG. Not too good for a 1.6 liter four cylinder with almost no horsepower. I bought it thinking it would be alot like the Geo Metro only bigger. The Metro was quicker,and got half again more mileage, Boy do I miss it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first new car and I have not been disappointed. It is practical in terms of price, but very nicely designed as well. It is a small vehicle, which is perfect for fitting into small parking spaces, but inside it doesn't feel cramped.

<TEXT>I have come to love driving it but it lacks acceleration and the miles per gallon are not that great. I estimate that I get maybe 15mpg as oppose to the 26 to 32 that I have seen posted on the sticker. The head room is great, as for the leg room which can become an issue with passengers in the back.

<TEXT>We just got our Aveo in December. I used it for a business conferance to Lake Geroge - 350 miles across southern NY. I set the cruise at 70 for most of the trip. I'm a big fellow - 270 - and I felt the car was pretty peppy. Lots of head room and body room. And considering I averaged 34 mpg, I think the car's a good deal. The dealer sold the car to us for just under 12000, including rebates. All we added was cruise control. We only have three thousand miles on it, but so far it runs like a champ. By the by. I had good winter tires installed at purchased - along with extra rims. The car handles very well in heavy snow and on ice with those tires. </TEXT>

I switched out a few things and customized the car, like two tone black and tan leather seats. The factory only offers tan leather, a little too much. Gets good gas mileage, has plenty of space and really no complaints. I even went back to the dealer just to price some parts to see the cost and the parts are inexpensive! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Best deal on basic transportation, hands down! Drove out of the dealership with a brand new Aveo for $7250. Granted, this included a $2K GM Card rebate, but without it, I would have gotten it for $8250, a price including TTL. Performance is adequate, lots of room, and no power locks/windows that will break in a few years anyways. Great GM warranty. Build quality is very good. Engine is a bit weak; you'll need to downshift to make it up a steep hill. Gas mileage is good, not stellar. Appreciate the side-impact airbags. For the price, it's unbeatable! Lots of 2007's still on dealer lots if you look. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wanted a solid commuter with modern options, and liked the look of the newly redesigned Aveo. No doubt, this is a small car, but it does feel pretty spacious on the inside. I got the LT with leatherette interior, and it is definitely a cut above your average domestic. The car feels solid and is easy to drive; my only real concern is high winds on the interstate. Car feels like it might simply get carried up up and away. Also, long-term quality is a possible issue but I guess I'll just have to see on that one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car mainly for the fuel economy. This is the only area it reached my expectations. I have had it into the dealer 4 times for problems. One of them involved replacing the main seal which took a week! This is a defect in the vehicle, other Aveo's have the same problem. The car didn't even have 8000 miles on it. Then within a week I had to have a sensor replaced. In the past I have always been pleased with GM vehicles but this one is a major disappointment. I don't feel safe driving it long distances and I am glad there is a dealer near my home and another near my work. I will be getting rid of this car ASAP.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I came into the Aveo because my full sized truck was guzzling too much gas. I wanted an inexpensive commuter. I ended up with a pretty upscale, (for an Aveo) 4 dr LT and it's much more car than I expected. It's smooth on the highway, and comfortable and has many features you wouldn't normally expect to find in this price range like side airbags. The sound system is nice with the MP3 changer and the steering wheel controls are good too. I went to the dealership just looking, but the price was too good to pass up after I saw how much car I could get for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got tired of commuting in my SUV getting 20mpg in summer and 18 in winter. Bought the Aveo on Edmund's study of lowest vehicle cost per mile. We get 31 to 34 in the city commuting and took one trip of 300 miles one way. 31 into the wind of 20+ mph and 38 coming with the wind. Has plenty of power for most needs. Haven't found anything to complain about. Does what it was made to do. Economy car shoppers beware of the foreign car hype of high gas mileage, we rented several of them before buying and found them to be lacking in mpg from what the manufacturer advertised. This is made by Daewoo plant to Chevy specs, but at least our money stays in the USA. Good job GM.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice sound system. Plugin for Ipod and MP3 player. The roomiest small car we test drove. I am 6'1" and have plenty of leg room front and back. Cup holders don't seem to be a problem for us. Good sound insulation. Engine noise is minimal. Road noise almost non-existant. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I run a service center for a dealer and I am very familiar with cars. I bought American because I am always able to get 250k + out of all my cars. It wasnt until recently that I needed to put my GMC truck to bed and get an import. I looked at Toyota, Nissan (great cars), Mazda, Honda etc. I finally picked the 2007 Chevy Aveo because of price, comfort and gas mileage. However, I am not getting anywhere near 37mpg as my sticker suggested. Believe me I understand driving habbits but this has nothing to do with it. I drive all freeway miles with no A/C on at no more than 70mph and the best milage I get is 30.1mpg. Yes I also tryed going under 70mph and I only got max 32.1 mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned Aveo 5 now for 2 weeks. I chose this vehicle over the honda fit because of price difference (about $3000), Versa because no fold flat or flip and fold seats, Yaris because I needed a 4 door hatch, and PT because of fuel economy. I also chose the Aveo because by far it had the best styling of all of them. The seat covers are durable and attractive and I loved the carbon fiber look trim. On to the driving, it is a much better driving experience than would be expected from a budget sub compact. It is quiet, zippy for such a low horsepower,and overall handles as well if not better than some of the pricier cars I have owned. Plenty of cargo room with flip and fold seats too! Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is really a fine little car. I am a professional, but got tired of sending my gas money to foreign lands. The Aveo gets good mileage (27 in city, 37 on highway). Not great, but good. Considering the price of the car, great mieage. The result is a very affordable car that gets good mileage, has some style, and is fun to drive. I am amazed that is has not given me any trouble at all. I drive it a lot. We took it on a 1,600 mile drive recently and it is more comfortable than a larger sedan. My main complaint is the small sun visor, and weak cup holders. I would buy another, great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a low cost alternative to a used vehicle, the Aveo is a great choice. Gas mileage has ranged from 32.4 to 36.6 mpg. I had been shopping for a new commuter for about 9 months and had seen the special value Aveo advertised by two local dealers for less than $8,000 a couple of times. Finally decided that the next time I saw them offered in this price range, I would buy. I ended up paying $7,660. The Aveo should serve very well as an economical run about. Its not the Prius that I really wanted, but was 1/4 the cost and still gets very respectable mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a great car for the money. (After all, you wouldn't buy a car like this unless low cost was important to you!) It's very stylish inside and out and seems well made so far (1200 miles). Engine is fuel efficient but I am surprised it isn't more so. Chevrolet and the Korean manufactures of the Aveo could make some simple improvements to make it a great car...variable speed intermittent wipers, actual electronic door lock buttons, more storage, better cup holder location in the front seat, etc. Overall, it is a good car for those on a tight budget.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fantastic car..consistantly get 32+ in the city w/ AC on and well over 40 MPG on the highway. Drive the car reasonably, as it's meant to be - it's not a sports or performance car so it shouldn't be driven as such - keep the cruise on the highway at 70-75 MPG and you'll be suprised. Yes the Aveo can go 90+ MPH if it needs to. No problems at all with car at 13500 - Many compliments on LT Sedan. Well worth the money. No complaints at all except the cup holders! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Being a full-time student with very little funds, I was very limited on which car I could buy. I didn't necessarily want the Aveo at first, especially after finding out that it was Korean made, and had some bad reviews. However, I have to say that I absolutely enjoy this car. I love how I don't have to be right on top of the steering wheel (I'm 5 foot even) The interior is cheapy, but really? I needed a car to get from A to B with the best gas possible for the less price. I found it. I couldn't be happier with my choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very impressed with the ride comfort an handling of this car. It is a vast improvement over subcompacts of previous generations. I really like the european stlying direction GM has been taking with the vehicles it has brought to market over the last few years. It is a little strained to accelerate up a hill starting from a standstill (but what the hell! it's no worse than our Jeep Liberty). The shift quality could be a little better, but here again, I didn,t purchase a Porsche. To sum up, in terms of interior and exterior styling, fuel economy, ride comfort, and handling it is a very good value for the money. I made my purchase chioce over Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must say that even though I purchased this car for my wife, I really want it for myself. I drive it any chance I get. It is actually quite sporty in both the design and handling. Very little came with the car, in terms of features but it is worth it! I have pretty decent credit and although I may not have gotten the best rate out there, I still feel like my payment is nothing. Most importantly, it is a safe, car with side airbags standard, and has a great crash rating (hope we never have proof of that!) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Size matters... I can park anywhere! I get in and out of places my Jeep can't go! Simple engine. It was nothing to boost HP by changing the air intake filter. Style. Tinted the windows, added some 17" chrome rims, and a spoiler. Wow! Cheap and easy. I did have to add a CD player, though.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The low cost of ownership in this hatchback is what initiallly attracted us. The main thing that finally sold us was that both my wife (5'3", 125 lb) and I (6'2", 220 lb) could find reasonably comfortable driving positions. Many other small cars do a poor job of accomodating those of us who aren't about the standard 5'8". It is surprisingly roomy inside--there is actually enough headroom to for me to sit up in the backseat. The Aveo's performance and mileage, while adequate, could be better, but you can't have everything at this price point. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very light weight, handles very poorly in wind. Gets a nasty screeching noise from doors or mirrors when driving in wind. Front engine crankshaft seal failed yesterday, lost all oil, damaged engine, oil/idiot light did not come on before engine started knocking. GM will only replace damaged parts, which is the crankshaft and bearings. Not pleased with that, should get a fresh engine and waranty. Manual transmission is already showing signs of problems, clunks into gear and sometimes hard to get into first. I am not a kid hot roding it. Its a commuter car, I drive it carefully. </TEXT>

I am 6'2" and a little over 250 pounds and I have no trouble getting in or out of the car. I am amazed at the amount of room. My only suggestion would be change the cup holders, but for the price how can I complain. The car has great fit and finish and the room inside is amazing. I even get people telling me how much they like my car when I am in town.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned and driven this car for 2 months, I am impressed with its comfort and driveability in city traffic. We have studded tires where I live and the rough pavement on local freeways is a bit harsh to drive on but all other characteristics are fine. This is my 18th vehicle over 39 years and it delivers everything I thought it would! I bought this car as an inexpensive alternative to a used vehicle for good mileage in city work commutes and it fills the bill perfectly!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best feature is fuel economy. Keeping the tach between 1500 and 2500 rpms gives me 28-29 city and 41 highway miles. I tend to move through the gears quickly. This is no muscle car so don't try to hotrod it and it will deliver.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Aveo. It is a fun sporty car. It has a lot of little extras. I've gotten some people asking me if it is a Volkswagen. If you compare a Jetta with it you'll find that the body is similar. It has lots of leg and head room. It feels as if you are sitting in a real chair and has good interior styling-flashy dashboard and stereo knobs etc. The engine is spaced out enough that a do-it-yourself mechanic can work on it comfortably.It's an American car which hopefully means cheaper parts, though I have heard that American cars tend to break down more so we'll see in the long run what's least expensive. With chrome lined lights, a spoiler and a sunroof this is the cutest little car Chevy makes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has an MP3 player input and great options for stereo equalizer functions, etc. The sunglass compartment is unique. Gotta love the driver's seat arm rest. Fold down rear seats. Huge trunk space. It's nice to look at, fun to drive, and the price was very reasonable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle primarily for fuel economy. I consistently get 36-40 mpg in normal driving. Babying it a bit has returned several 43-45 mpg tankfulls. Running it hard on the freeway (80+ mph) drops the mileage to the 30-33 range. Comfort is good for a car of this class - comparable to my old Honda Civic. I love the lumbar support in the driver's seat. The transmission is geared well to deal with the car's modest engine torque while coming up to speed; and cruises well at highway speeds. I have not encountered any high speed or crosswind instability. Vehicle is built tight, and after 3500 miles, has proven to be quite reliable. Cornering and braking are better than I expected. </TEXT>

I rented a 2006 Malibu over the summer, and I think this is comparable in styling and driving (except for being only 4cyl). It's sharp and comfortable! Great visibility, and you feel like you're sitting high up. Love that it has an interior trunk and gas release. Good car for the money! I hope I find it reliable for years to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would have to say without a doubt that the improvments in styling for the 2007 model sold us but I especially liked the new rear tailight design. It is much bigger inside than it looks although rear space is limited but feels like a much more expensive car than it is. The ride is good for a small car and handling is also good and makes for easy parking. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I think this is a cute, fun, reliable car. I am glad I bought it. Nice transportation to and from my job, as well as around town. I check out many cars and it was a toss between the Aveo, Scion or the PT Cruiser. In the end I decided on the Aveo 5 hatchback. I got bright blue, which is a pretty color, but not my choice. Others I would have had to wait for, and I needed transportation in a hurry. I would have preferred the new cinnamon, pretty yellow or slate blue. All and all I am satisfied with my new little car and it fits in my driveway behind my husband's larger van. I needed a compact car for that reason. I have one suggestion regarding the side view mirrow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love them all. I like the tilt wheel. There is a place for an MP3 to be plugged in, but I have not used that as yet.

<TEXT>GM cannot figure out why they can't sell cars. Here is a pleasing, cool, practical contender in the Mini club but who's to know? Great gear box, precise steering feel, amazingly quiet with a compliant, controlled ride. The only weakness I could find: the seat has little support (you sit on it, not in it) and the headrest is somewhat annoying and doesn't support the head comfortably. But, a definite "must drive" when considering Fit, Yaris, etc. A well developed package for all-around use that puts a smile on your face.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When looking for an economy car that primarily would be used for work/commuting, I looked for in this order: reliablity/dependability, gas mileage, price, and options/looks. Amoung others looked at: Ford Focus, Saturn ION, and the economy one from Toyota (which I can't remember the name of but, not much to be disired either). After test driving and having the vehicle I have which is the Chevy Aveo. I am happy with its performance, maintenance, options, price, and gas mileage, and I like how it handles curves.
