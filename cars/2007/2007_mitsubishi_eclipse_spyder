<TEXT>I originally leased my vehicle back in March 07' After almost 3 years, it's been so reliable and so much fun to drive that I decided to go ahead and purchase it before my lease was up. Great car, just wish it wasn't front wheel drive and had a better turning radius.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car quite unexpectedly. I saw it in a Mitsubishi lot and the design drew me in. After extensive test drives (and web research), I was pleasantly surprised. It has power, comfort, handling, and style. The convertible top is so easy to put up or down. The interior is amazingly quiet when the top is up. I've had the car for 6 months and its still a joy to own and drive. I highly recommend this car! Consumer Reports doesn't have much nice to say about this car. But actual owners adore the Eclipse. Listen to the owners! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine power, Convertible top ease of use, and gas mileage 19 City, 24 highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been wanting this car since I started driving. I was looking at the previous generation models and they were nice, because I figured I couldn't afford a new one. However, they are very affordable, and I was able to get a 2007. So far I am loving this car as I knew I would, Sunset Pearlescent color is amazing, V6 is more than enough, very comfortable (except in the back seat, but I didn't buy it for people to ride in the back). I got used to the blind spots within days.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Color, overall design that you don't see very often, V6 engine, top opens at the push of a button, MP3 6 CD changer is great. LED tail lights are nice, usually only see those on more expensive cars.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I loved this car when I bought it brand new, however, there are too many blind spots when driving with the top up. I have had this car for 8 months and I have to take it in, the top hydraulic system is out already and needs to be checked. I feel the frame of the car is weak. The car is so low that the nose scraps on everything. This car is an accident waiting to happen with all the blind spots. Other than that, the car is beautiful and gets lots of looks</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in Colorado and wanted a sporty convertible that could be driven all year, even in snow. I wanted a little extra room to carry things on a road trip. I wanted an easy roof to put up and take down. Lastly, good gas mileage. This car does it all! The front wheel drive got me through every snowstorm last winter. We just completed a 2500 mile road trip and carried a bunch of family heirlooms in the trunk and back seat. We averaged 26.5 MPG with the four cylinder driving 4 mph over the limit all the time. The top goes up or down in 17 seconds with no tucking or booting, can be done at a stop light.It is the only new car I have ever purchased that hasn't been back to the dealer for warranty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Front wheel drive, more comfortable ride than most comparables, more room for stuff,enough power in the 4 cylinder yet good gas mileage, an easy up/down roof, great sunset pearl finish, (Metallic copper), great stereo, lots of compliments</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Absolutely love this car! Got it for better fuel economy (traded an Xterra), and I get about 300 miles to a tank, more on the highway (though not too much more). The car is just a joy to own and drive. No unscheduled maintenance needed yet, but the vehicle is young (9 months so far). The convertible top folds down very quickly - ~19 seconds. All that said, there are complaints. See suggested improvements</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Satisfying engine rumble when you let loose, stereo is awesome, *decent* gas mileage, convertible top is quick and of good quality, pretty comfortable and roomy up front (the back is a different story), handles well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I own an Endevor and the quality of that made me look at the Spyder. I'm very happy with this car. The speed and handling is very acceptable. You don't buy this car for backseat space. Overall, so far I have really had no problems with this car. My wife loves driving it also and my friends are very impressed with the stereo and the sleek sexy look of it. The convertible drops down so smooth and tucks away in the trunk.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hide away top in the trunk is awesome. My friend has a convertible mustang and it flaps in the wind, good design on the spyders part. The stereo of course is awesome but does rattle the sub when it gets to a certain point. Very fast and fun to drive. Duh it's a convertible....enough said!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The trunk is big enough for all of my and my son's luggage when we go to the airport. The car is fun to drive, but most of all I love the stereo. I can fit about 140 songs on an MP3 CD, and the in-dash will take 6 of them, so there's no need for an iPod. After almost 18 months though, there is a rattle from the subwoofer at certain frequencies. Taking it tomorrow to get that fixed under warranty. All in all, I love this car! It's not perfect, but fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo, short-throw shifter, accelearation, stereo, body design, driving without a roof, stereo, handling (at 40mph+), blue-lit dashboard, stereo, ABS (comes in handier than you might think), this car just plain makes driving enjoyable for me again :)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have wanted this car for ten years and bought it brand new off the lot. Have really enjoyed having it. I have a four year old daughter and it is somewhat friendly even for her. The top is easy to put up and down. It handles like a dream and I drive it hard. It is really good on the road with wind not blown all over the place and the safty features are great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is fun! The lack of features excluded at purchase can be dishearting but can be made up in the overall performance of the vehicle. In my first year of ownership, regular oil changes have maintained a smooth running vechile. The only real problems I have experienced is with the steering radius and electronic drop top. Small cosmetic pieces popping off were an issue. Thus far, the eclipse is a realiable vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Started shopping for a two-seater convertible; Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Skye, Nissan 350Z all great cars, but either gutless or too spendy. Found my Spyder, with 3,440 miles, 5 grand less than new and the previous owner had put on 245/35ZR20 low profile tires and 20" rims. No brainer. This car is so much fun to drive, a little more room than a conventional two-seater, handles corners great, the wind doesn't knock it around and the top is much quieter than my Mustang convertible GT was. Comfortable on road trips, excellent exhaust note. Shifting is a breeze and a pleasure. Stereo adjusts automatically when you put the top down, lines are sleek and sporty. Love it all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Clean lines inside and out, interior lighting and comfort, exhaust, quick and efficient top stowaway, torque, the looks it gets, Fosgate soundsystem, even the attention to detail with the way the headlights are designed. With the 20" rims, it's drop dead gorgeous!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love driving this car! Love the look, the color, and the looks I get while driving it don't hurt either. I like the fact that my hair doesn't blow around very much with the top down. I'm disappointed with the nose mask. It's very difficult to put it on and it does not stay put! The paint is already damaged as a result. The mask is badly designed and unnecessarily complicated to use. I love the electric roof but so far, it has stuck in an awkward position 4 times. The 3rd time it was towed to the dealership, they found the problem and showed me how to fix it myself the next time! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sporty look. The color. The responsiveness, the dash board colors, and even the electric roof when it works properly. I like the fact that there is effectively no back seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before buying my 07 Spyder I first drove the Ford Mustang and then Pontiac GXP Solstice. Great body design on the Spyder had me at first glance. The first 3 minutes behind the wheel of the Spyder convinced me. Lot's of power with 260 hp v6 engine, comfortable seats and just plain fun to drive. I felt like a kid again. Something I was expecting from the Mustang or the GXP, but they failed to provide. My first Mitsubishi, sorry it took me so long.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a play toy for the wife and me. Got the automatic for her, but no regrets. Between the V6 and the Sportronic mode I can have my fun. Love the looks, power, handling and that awesome stereo. Plenty of room in the front seats. The back seat is for kids only, but hey it's a convertible. It's not supposed to be practical. A great fun car to cruise the scenic backroads with. The sunset pearlescent paint and the body style really gets attention. This is the most expensive car we have ever bought. It has all the options.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fifth consecutive Eclipse, by far the best. Hard to believe actually! So fast, and even with the 18" wheels, rides very well in our rough NJ pavement. Cuts corners like a pro, shift throws are short, braking is strong. Fuel mileage is so-so compared to my last GT 5-speed, but it makes up for it in sheer power. Thanks Mitsu for finally installilng a REAL sound system, heated seats, a windscreen, auto climate control, and an automatic boot cover. Those few things totally transform the car and make it feel much more expensive than it actually is. Love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The six speed manual performes smoothly. Torque is impressive in all gears. Convertible top operates like magic. Rear seating is very limited. Makes my daily commute to work a pleasure. The lines of the car are distinctive and will get you second looks. Little torque steering from front wheel drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the car for nearly a month, but half of the time has been at the dealer with steering problems. The car pulls to the left, pulls really hard in the left lane of a 5 lane freeway and as you move to the right, to the far right lane, still pulls left. Has been test driven by several dealer service people including a Mitsubishi engineer and a frame shop alignment specialist. The cars, as it turns out is designed that way, there is no correction. The car is very fatiguing to drive. The fabric seats are also very hot, don't breath. May have to return the car. Test drove 5 of the cars, they all do it and the engineer agrees. Hard to believe but they have designed cars that pull left.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a new summer car and the Eclipse Sypder was one of many options I was considering. After careful review and a pleasant Mitsubishi dealer I purchased my 2007 Eclipse Sypder GT right off the showroom floor. I left the next day and went to Texas on a road trip and this car is amazing to drive. It handles well and has plenty of power. I went to San Antonio, TX so once there I was able to put the top down and really enjoy the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The whole car. I really enjoy the styling and the ease of the convertible top operation. This is my 2nd Spyder and they just keep getting better.

<TEXT>I have owned three convertibles prior to this one and it is by far the best value and hottest looking one I have owned. It is gorgeous, fun-to-drive and and very spacious inside. The top stowage system is superb and works flawlessly. The brakes are great. However, I am not happy that this is such a heavy car with the same horsepower as a Pontiac Solstice, which is half as big. What gives? My engine should have another 100 horsepower to really move. All-in-all, there is no other car to compare at this price. I drove the Miata, Solstice, BMW Z4, 300Z and none have the roomy interior, killer sound system, awesome top and "drool appeal." </TEXT>

I owned a '92 Mitsubishi VR4, I missed it until October 2006, when I tested drove the 2007 Spyder, I drove out of the lot that night, while I was there to see another car with my cousin for his wife. The car drives with a feeling of hugging the road which is a good feeling when shifting yes the 6-speed. Girls rule. While the 9 speakers, heated leather seats 6 changer CD MP3 player along with the convertible brings it all into one place and time of being a wonderful driving machine. Oh yeah, should I mention the sweet purr of power with that V6 engine. Sweet! Girls rule with this machine (boys get jealous! LOL). In all the car is a beast amongst the others and it's affordable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When looking for a new vehicle I wanted a convertible with front-wheel drive that fit my golf clubs for a reasonable price. This car fits all four criteria. My son always said,"Dad, get a fun car." Well, that's what I got. This car is just a joy to drive-comfortable, quiet, and great sound system with fingertip controls. Personally, my complaint is that now when I need a car to fit four, I don't have one. The complaint about the car itself, though, is the blind spot. It IS difficult to see out the back and side of this car-no doubt. But my criteria was met and if I concern myself with just that, then I made a great choice. I get about 18 mpg locally and 27 highway. And don't forget, it takes premium gas. I get nothing but oohs and ahhs, with this car and I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my Spyder for two weeks and I'm in love. I find it hard to keep my hands off her leather-wrapped steering wheel. This car is very fun to drive with very responsive steering, amazing acceleration for a 4-cyl., a satin smooth suspension, and a stereo system so AWESOME that my friend described it as wearing top quality headphones. With the top down, wind noise is no problem for the stereo system. Can anyone find the 9- speakers? I've only found 7 of the 9. Everyone teases me about the basically unusable back seats, but I call it the dedicated sub-woofer space. Everybody thinks this car cost twice what it cost me, in other words this convertible is a fantastic value too. I'm lovin' It!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ease of the convertible top, sexy styling, very good gas mileage, shockingly fast acceleration for a 4-cyl engine, KICK- BUTT Stereo, stereo controls on the back-side of the steering wheel, how fun it is to drive, and the suspension is perfect - not too stiff or too bouncy. This car's fit and finish is excellent, very BMW-like.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Spyder, I currently have a 1999 Red Convertable Spyder which is still in excellent condition and still gets the looks. We saw the 2007 and needed a second updated Spyder. They both sit in my driveway and I always get comments about the two. The 2007 is much larger and they look cute together. My husband now drives the 1999 and I drive the 2007. He has to ask me to switch every so often. I told him I get enough stares as it is, but with this car, it is amazing how many comments I get about me and the car. Ladies, this is a great pickup car if your interested. I love the quick takeoff, and the sporttronics is fantastic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We test drove the 350Z. It had no interior room. Then we tried the Soltice. Nope, it needs a bigger engine. The Mustang nice, but it uses old technology and gets poor gas mileage. The Mini Cooper is to yuppy. The Honda 2000 is a faster Miata, but it is too small, The Mazda RX-8 is very unconfortable. Its arm rest is too high, it has a quirky engine, and the air didn't work very well. The Toyota Solara made for Grandmas. The Corvette is too common. At last we come to the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spider. It is a fun, sporty car that my wife and I love. It's our weekend cruiser. It's fast, comfortable, sporty, and I love how the top is buried.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my '07 Eclipse Spyder in June and it was great until the first incident in September. One rear Bridgstone tire separated the tread at 2,400 miles. Had it been on the front, I would have been injured. This also damaged the rim. I went back to the dealer who stated, "not our problem, it's not covered under the warranty." They directed me to Bridgestone who "did me a favor" by replacing the tire. No one wants to cover the damaged rim due to Mitsubishi putting defective tires on their new car. After only 2,400 miles, I think the dealer could have been more receptive to this dangerous condition. I still love the vehicle, but don't trust my life to the tires. I'll use my own money to replace all four tires now.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling is great. The engine gets good gas milage and the 4-cyl. is very responsive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well. I get stopped by neighbors every day telling me how nice my car is. The car drives very smoothly. As far as the power goes, I stepped into this car from owning a V8 truck and with the manual transmission and I don't feel the difference except for in my wallet at the gas pump! I love my 2007 Mitsubishi Spyder.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the outside design, the attention to detail on the inside, the awesome sound system, and how easy and fast the top comes down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife has always said she loved spyders and pushed me to get one until I finally gave up. I was driving by when I saw the 2007 Eclipse and decided to stop. I fell in love with this car as soon as I sat in it. I took it home to the wife and she was in complete shock that I broke down and got it! Riding around town with the top down is just great and this car will turn heads!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything is very sporty. It has a fun enjoyable ride and a great sound system to go along with everything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a convertable and was interested in the Saturn Sky, since I was not able to get one of those, I started looking at other cars. I happened to test drive the '07 Eclipse day while looking at options, and I fell in love. This car is awesome. I have gotten more looks in this car and the way it rides is unbelievable. I would highly recommend getting this car to anyone who want a 4 seat convertable. I have kids so that is also what helped me decide.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The feel of the car when driving it, it rides very nice, the stereo is awesome for a factory stereo. And the gas mileage is not bad either.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Even the 2.4L four cyl. is fun but the power band does not even start untill 3,500 RPM. This car gets great gas milage, which is the only reason not to get the 3.6L. Maybe a cold air intake and a new chip will wake up the engine. It also has a lot of torque steer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With the top down it is still quite quiet. The sound system is an 8 out of 10. The ride is a 9. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at several convertibles before going with the Spyder. At the end it the Spyder vs. the MINI S. The tonneau top, superior AC, and vastly more comfortable seats gave the nod to the Spyder. The MINI S, although a quicker and tighter ride, was left to someone else willing to pay a hefty premium. The GT has plenty of power although it does not really kick in until the RPMs hit 4,000. Because of this I prefer that the TAC is on the left where I can see it. This comes in handy when playing with the Sportronic AT whilst driving with the top down and Rockford system UP. Go leather and get the heated seats. My dealer loaned me a cloth overnight and the heat was sorely missed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Um, the convertible top! The sound system is very good. Sportronic is fun. The interior design is clean and intuitive. The steering wheel controls are easy to use. So far I like it all. And a it comes with a warranty that I hope the car never needs due to the great workmanship.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had my '07 Eclipse for a little over a month. But so far..WOW. The design is nice. The back end looks great. The front end could use a little spicing up. The inteior design is nothing short of great. The sound system is dynamic. The top is easy to open and close and the it tucks away semlessly. The 4-cylinder leaves a little to be desired on power in takeoffs, BUT..again, I bought it for fuel economy. So the trade off is OK. The bottom line is: as a motorcycle rider, this is just as much fun and I don't have to put my feet down at a stop sign!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the new Eclipse after looking at several other choices in the convertible area, namely the 350Z and the Solara. After test-driving the three cars I chose the Eclipse mainly because the bang for the buck factor. The Solara was just as expensive but bland, slow, and ugly. The Z was great but too much money (it was a tough choice between the two). The eclipse has tons of power and torque, a great sound system, and IMO unique but great styling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Eclipse Spyder. I had an '01 and '03, and by far this is the best one ever! From the inside to the out, I am in love with the new style. At 48 years old I feel like a school kid again. And the comments that I'm getting on this car are remarkable. It is more soild than the past Spyders and it is great to drive. This car is a keeper in my book. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the great seats, you'll fit in them not like the models in the past. It is near how the top is hidden when down, you only see that on the high priced cars, The sound system is A+.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I hated the Eclipse Spyder from 2000-2005, I had a 1999 one that I loved but traded it in when my son was born. I saw the 2007 and drooled when I test drove it. I can't stop driving it and I live in Vegas so I have the top down a lot. With all my driving I'm spending too much money on gas :(. The stereo system is awesome and I love the blue back lit dashboard at night!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must say I may be biased, as it took one 10 minute test drive to win my heart. Acually, to be fair, I think I fell in love with this car from the moment I first laid eyes on it's sleek lines and daunting 18" wheels. Driving the car just renewed my faith in the ability of an attainable car bringing a smile to my face on all levels. From the well built interior to the formidable performace, this car will not disappoint.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far so good, This is my second Eclipse Spyder from Mitsubishi. It has a nice appearance. I get compliments from all who see it, even strangers in parking lots. Hopefully the interior will hold up better then the '01 model. I wasn't going to buy anoher one, I waited over a year for the new Pontiac G6 convertible...what a disappointment. I left the Pontiac dealer and drove back to Mitsubishi. I went down to a 4-cyl. from the V6 I was used to driving, but the power was great. The V6 felt great. This car does not have a lot of people room, but it has plenty of shopping room. It has very sensitive controls. I am glad they got rid of the Infinity sound system. Overall I give this car a 9.5.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at many others we love this vehicle. It is appropriately powered allowing its acceleration to be smooth and consistent while the handling is precise and effortless, all adding up to an outstanding driving experience. Its updated styling inside and out appeals to all age groups - including this 50ish couple who love to drive lots of different vehicles. Its gas mileage is good even considering the need to use premium fuel. I appreciate the attention to detail and ease of maintenance. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The comfortable leather seats, power convertible top, temperature control, eighteen inch wheels and sound system top the list with other thoughtful features such as the alloy fuel door and pedals.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Heads are turning as my new 2007 Mitsubishi GT Eclipse Sypder rolls down the road. This new model year vehicle seems to draw a lot of interest from the public - and with good reason - the car is very attractive. I purchased the GT 6-speed manual and have thoroughly enjoyed the power and smooth shifting-ability. It has a nice growl to it as well. This car makes sense for all convertible seekers, but value may be the key. While the back seat is smaller, one can easily fit two small kids comfortably, two small ladies for a drive around town, or extra luggage on a trip. The trunk will fit two golf (mini) bags! Excellent... finally, the stereo - It rocks. Grab some music, flip the top and drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love this car's smooth lines and exterior appearance. It looks great with the top up or down. It has nice exterior light designs and great wheels. The GT model's stereo has excellent power for a convertible. I love the subwoofer appearance. It has great accleration, great shifting, comfortable seats in front, cool blue dash lights at night, and a large trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 6-speed auto 2006 Corvette Coupe for the 6-speed manual Eclipse Spyder GT. I found the car much more "responsive" and easier to live with on a daily basis, and I've owned numerous sports cars, including 3 Vettes. After only 200 miles the care gets 21 MPG in city driving. It is a real "sleeper"....and great has quality for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The great engine / throttle response, steering feel, zip, and engine/exhaust "sound". It has great convertibe top operation.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2007 Eclipse Spyder just 10 days ago and I'm still in love! It's so much fun to drive - turns corners really well - and I love driving a 5 speed. My only complaint is that the A/C knobs and temperature dial are not available to the passenger if the driver is shifting. The stereo is also amazing. Putting the top up/down is not only easy - but fun! I don't drive very many miles to/from work - however, it appears that I'm getting pretty good gas mileage. In a few months I'll write another review (once the honeymoon is over)!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ease of putting top up/down. Overall look of vehicle. Seats are very comfortable. Turns easily and can make very sharpt turns. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Eclipse Spyder. I bought a new 2001 in 2000. I had to get another one. Mitsubishi has made many improvements. The new one is longer, wider, and taller. It rides great. If you can afford it, stretch and get the GT. The top is great. I have gotten many comments on it. It handles great, rides great, and looks great. It comes with many standard features. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder is a very nice car. It's one of the nicest cars I have owned. I have been told by some people that I work with that the car is for girls, but no way in heck. The only way I would say that it is a female car if it is painted a color like purple or pink.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features would have to be the seats. I like the way they feel when I sit in them. I have sat in nicer seats, but they are good. It rides nicely, not like a Caddilac or any car with air ride, very nice. This car is smooth and easy to control. It was a good buy for sure.</FAVORITE>
