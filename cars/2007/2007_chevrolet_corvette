<TEXT>This corvette has been a nightmare. The first thing was the top creaks when hot and has been to the shop 4 times and still not fixed. Both front sway bar links had to be replaced and the entire rack and pinion. The drivers bottom seat panel has to be replaced and the battery has been replaced. The problems just keep mounting and for a car that costs this much I would have expected better quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Don?t get me wrong the car is so much fun to drive and looks great but the interior quality is very bad and does not compare to any German or Japanese cars? quality. It feels a little cheap. My friend drives a 2008 BMW M3 which is comparable to the vette in power and price but the interior quality on the beemer is much better than my corvette for the same price. Some of my interior trim is coming off and the car is still under warranty. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first GM car in 25 years. It's a 2007 coupe with 6M Z51 2LT with about 14K miles. It's a dream come true. GM has really put together a great combination of performance, practicality, and efficiency. Performance in every aspect will make you forget your troubles for awhile when driving. I'm pleasantly suprised at the effecient engine compartment layout as well as the well placed traditional interior controls, right where they should be. The interior, while good, could use a few improvements. However, overall, this is a great car. Only a slight roof sqeak and a differental noise, both corrected with known fixes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cornering and acceleration. For the mid-lifers like me the seats are great with the best lumbar support I've found in any car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first Corvette was a 1957 that I sold in 1979 to buy my Home. I now have a new 2007 Coupe that was worth waiting for. It looks and drives just the way I want it to. Just enough power to get in trouble with. I drive the Corvette to work in good weather. It's the best feeling to drive a car that you love, even if it's just to work. Jay Leno said it best; "if you don't like the interior, buy a nice Dinette set."</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned Corvettes since my first in 1974. I bought it new upon my return from Vietnam. I traded my 2004 in on this one and it is by far the best one I have owned. My next one may be the new ZR1 that just came out, but I am not sure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I guess I can start by saying this car is my mid-life crisis car, anyway the car performs everytime time I put my foot into. It fires like a bullet, no complaints for power, but there are some other problems so beware. My vehicle has had molding on the driver & passengers side replace twice for peeling. Front windshield crack and replaced due to body stress as descibe in my documentation. Rear differential went out grining noise when backing up or going around curves. Dealer wants to add rear differential TSB-additive waste of time. My passenger door has a continous rattle in the center of the panel with very little volume on speakers. GM fix is adding foam to interior of door, doesn't work.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Reliability is not there. Electrical system drains battery so car will not start if car is left parked for more than 10 days. So many things on this car are attached to the battery--it does nothing but kill battery. Try taking this car to the airport and come back 2 weeks later and see what happens. When you're not driving for even short periods in must be plugged in to a charger. Dealer says all is working properly-- even the car manual says battery will not last more than 25 days?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Soon after I got this car something inside the door panel started to rattle. Had to go to 3 different dealer to finally get one willing to take the door panel off to fix. Squeaks/rattle all over the car when driving on rough surface. Roof when stored in trunk squeaks like mad. Window squeaks when rolled all the way up where it hits the roof. Dealer would apply some lube which works for about a week then rattle/squeaks returns and becomes worse. Get real people with 400hp the acceleration isn't much faster than a V6 Toyota Camry with 270hp. It probably is not worth to endure the noisy tire and all the poor interior. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 07 C6 6 speed auto coupe is now broken in. I drive it only in good weather and stow it in winter, so every time I use it is a treat. Just returned from a 1300mi road trip. It is a perfect road car for two. Very comfy, plenty of passing power when you need to leave the 18wheelers in the dust, and stores plenty of luggage, golf clubs, etc. The base version is just great. It has all of the creature comforts needed. Only problem has been some noise in the rear differential which was corrected by dealer with a TSB- recommended additive to the differential lube. If I lived in a warmer climate I'd use this car as my daily driver. It's well made and I'm proud to drive the best all-American sports car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had a lot of different sport cars and roadsters which includes MG's to 1967 Firebird, 1972 Chevelle SS, 1967 Triump, BMW's Z-3, Z-4 and the 3 series which then led me back to machines that can perform like my Harley Davidson VRod with a few mods pushs over 120hp. Nothing even comes close to coming back to an American made quality product like the Corvette. You really need to start looking at what GM has produced its better quality than any foreign car that I've owned in the last 20 years. Chevy, you rock.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went from a 2001 ZO6 to a 2007 coupe. The coupe's ride is signifigantly smoother than the ZO6 and I recommend the coupe as a daily driver vs ZO6. The coupe is very powerful & styling can't be beat. I receive a lot of turned heads & waives from other Vette drivers. Gasoline mileage is good not great, lots of cargo space but interior fit & finish lacking. Has been in and out of the shop for warranty issues; cigarette lighter not working - glove box open/close latch keeps breaking - cheap plastic. Removable top, although light in weight for it's size, needs two people to safely taking on-off. As a previous owner of a ZO6 I'd opt for the coupe every time as ZO6 is designed for racing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The coupe Corvette is a performance vehicle combining great looks, technology, and high end performance. Head Up Display, improved interior over pervious model, cargo space, seating comfort and it is a one of a kind and extremely enjoyable to drive. Reliability average recommend extended warranty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Corvette. The first was a Yellow C5 Coupe. It was an awesome car and I loved every day I drove it. This White C6 is also a great car. I was so enamored with the extra 50hp that I didn't even notice how bad the "paddle shifters" were until I'd had it for a couple months. The six-speed auto is head and shoulders above the four-speed auto that was in my C5. But forget using the paddles. By the time it actually changes gears, the moment has passed and you forget you wanted to do something. I also preferred the C5s interior. I do love lots of the features of the C6 and in full-auto mode it's really quick. But I think I should have gotten the manual.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It took a little time for me to get used to a car with this much power, but I really enjoy the car. The riding comfort is great. the car rides very smoothly, however it is a little noisy. However the car is not as hot rough riding as its predecessors. Interior design is not bad and there is enough storage room for most items. There are some minor things that could have been done a little differently, but they are very minor. The exterior of the car is beautiful, a true American sports car, we can all be proud of. Gas mileage is great, I get 22 in the city and 30+ on the hwy. So far, quality and reliability are very good. Only one problem which has been corrected.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Targa roof, could not live without it. More than enough power for everyday driving. A great everyday car, unlike the Dodge Viper. Fun car to drive and great handling.

<TEXT>This is my first GM product. I am a self-described Mustang nut. My last vehicle was a 2004 SVT Cobra vert Mystichrome package. I have been critical of Vettes since the late 1970s. My last Cobra impressed on me, again, how uninspired contemporary Vettes were. Then the Z06 came out. After test driving a used 2006 model, I was smitten! We bought our Z06 on June 30, 2007. I am convinced and converted from Ford "faithfulness." This is the performance car for under $100,000.00!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After waiting 40 years to finally get the boyhood dream, I purchased an '07 Corvette only to find out the name went on before the quality went as the quality never made it. The car is great looking, runs great and is fun to drive, but the drive components and rear end are junk, whenever I turn or start out it is if I were going over bumps in the road, I took it back and the dealer simple lubed the rear end, this worked until the lube wore and the problem reappeared again. On the second trip it was found that a tech bulletin had been generated for the problem and the dealer replaced the friction pads,this didn't cure the problems.I am getting rid of it after this. No more American cars for me</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car will make you believe in American sports cars. As you get on to the highway shifting into second the back slips just a little and you look down doing seventy-five, and the sheer adrenaline cause your to fling it into third and push the hammer all the way down. Next thing you know your in sixth gear and didn't realize it. Seriously though the handling on this car is unreal add that with the huge powerplant and 400 hundred horsepower. I have driven a Z06, Viper SRT10, and a Masserati gransport - this car is only beaten by the Z06. If you have the extra 20K get the Z06 but if not this is an unreal mid-life crisis.</TEXT>

The clutch is also very hard to push and you will get a sore leg after awhile. Otherwise...I loveit! The exhaust sounds like the good old American muscle that I have been used to. Awesome brakes, handling is great, and most of all, great engine! The car turns heads because of its awsome design. My car is victory red. Red looks the best on this car. Fun car to drive. There is no car on the road that even think of racing you and your car, you look at them and laugh. The best thing is...power!</TEXT>

Putting the pedal to the floor provides a thrill of excitement and gets the heart racing. Traded in an 06 350Z Roadster with a few after market performance parts and, without a doubt, the Vette blows it away in avery aspect of power, ride, handling, looks and technology. Not even sure why I bought the Z in the first place. Took a beating on the trade but well worth it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I drove this car into work for the first time, my collegues thought I had won the lottery or sold a kidney. Most people thought this car should have costed well over $100k when I paid less than $50k for a fully loaded variety. The fact that it stands out more, and severly outperforms a BMW Z4, Mercedes- Benz SLK320 and Porsche Boxter and costs the same (or even a little less) is astonishing. This car is absolutly gorgeous and I can't imagine why anyone else would possibly buy any other sports car in the $50k price range.

<TEXT>I've wanted a Vette since I first saw the '63 StingRay. Purchased my first; a C6 VictoryRed/Black coupe with auto6sp paddle shift, to replace a Honda S2000 convertible. The t-top was a wise choice for me, allowing the convertible experience while still allowing a quiet coupe ride and practical storage under the hatch. The 400 hp engine and 6sp paddle tranny gives plenty of power and sporty driving experience. It doesn't corner like a smaller roadster, but is a much better all around vehicle. Can store plenty of golf equipment and weekend luggage in the back, even with the t- top stowed. I find the stereo, a/c, basic seats and basic suspension to provide a very comfortable experience.</TEXT>

For the first time they have not allowed a specific price point to keep the car from becoming what it should have done many times over.

<TEXT> I've owned my 2007 Corvette since October 13, 2006 and have had problems with the electronics in alarm system (which continue), severe problems with rattles coming from behind the dashboard due to broken welds and roof pins that were too small, and a bad shock absorber. The first repair to fix the broken weld took almost 6- weeks. After a month and less than 500 miles the rattle is back. Great looking car with substantial performance, but extremely poor quality. I wouldn't recommend anyone spend $45,000 or more for such a poor quality car which inturn leads to continue fustrations trying to get your problems resolved.

My better half and I thoroughly enjoy the drive, especially with the option of the targa during the endless southern CA summers! No mechanical problems, good gas mileage (about 27 mpg highway, so far), beautiful paint (machine silver), titanium interior, XM radio, and paddle shifters in sport mode! Wonderful 400HP engine purrs along at highway cruising speeds, hardly breathing hard at 1800 rpm, then roars to life in an exciting way and eats up the road when presented with a chance to sprint.

<TEXT>I have had my 2007 C6 Coupe with paddle shift for a little over 2 months and have driven about 3,300 miles. The performance is exceptional. I've owned sedans from BMW (2002 and 535i), Infiniti (Q45,G35x), Mercedes 300D and Volvo S70, and sports models from Alfa Romeo And Subaru SVX, plus old time muscle cars ('66 Impala 396 and '67 Olds 442). The Corvette is by far the most powerful, best handling and most fun to drive. At $48,000 list, it is a great value. When driving sedately, it is as well behaved as a performance sedan. When you ask for speed and handling, it responds aggressively. Plus, I've been averaging a little over 21 mpg. Going to Spring Mtn Vette School next week. Can't wait!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The C5 was good, the C6 is superb, confident! Aston Martin's extreme luck in France notwithstanding, Corvette competes on a world stage: the street cars benefit directly from the race program. When it's all said and done, it's a Chevrolet: affordable; it is a practical two-seater that realizes nearly 30 miles to the gallon on the road. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I really can't believe what a docile driving beast this car is. You could easily step out of a Honda Civic and into this car finding it so very similar. Easy to drive, easy ride quality and refinement. Then the tach reaches 3500rpms and the beast is let loose big time! I take friends for rides and never do anything outrageous until the end of the ride and they are so surprised how quiet and comfortable it is. When they feel the power like me they wonder where it came from so quickly, so brutally. It is totally up to you...drive carefully and get 27mpg or like Mario Andretti, 3.6 seconds to 60 you can do either with this "everyday driver" able supercar.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far at 7000 miles, the car has been flawless. Explosive acceleration, delightful torque at any speed. The car is a red Z51 convertible 6 speed manual. This car has a dual personality. If you want to just commute normally, it's relatively quiet, smooth and docile. If you drop the hammer, it turns into an animal, loud and brash. Even frightening if you are not expecting it. Despite stiffer Z51 option, ride is firm, but not harsh, I was impressed also with the stiffness of the structure despite being a convertible. So far no rattles and a door squeak went away as weather warmed up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, engine, quickness of response to steering, brakes and of course, accelerator. Smoothness of powertrain power of brakes, instrumentation, overall build quality. Also, fuel economy impresses. I do a lot of freeway and I am averaging 22MPG...not bad for 400HP.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Updated All American look returns. Light years better in most depts. than C4-C5's. Well balanced design, performance and handling. If they'd only cure RF tire noise on concrete freeways. Retains a hint of earlier crude front suspension feedback on rough streets. Needs a hair more suspension travel. Good interior styling and (almost) quality look. GM had to include a cheesy painted plastic panel on forward console and climate/radio controls. Ltd leg room for over 6' 2" drivers, needs 3 more inches there. 6 spd auto allows broad power choice, just keep revs over 2K. After 6K mi. I've noticed occasional clunks shifting into R and occ sloppy/slow shifting in D or S. Must be the DBW. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I rarely drive my Corvette daily, but I drive it on the weekends around the city. The driving experience is absolutely refreshing, because the engine has so much torque available at any speed. The seats are comfortable along with the close proximity of the user controls which make drving the car more pleasureble. The most impressive feat of the Corvette is its ability to give very good highway miles per gallons in parallel with an engine that put creates 400HP. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a solid Amreican-made sports car.</TEXT>

Though it can be driven year round if you live in the northern climates like I, I'd recomend a winter beater.

<TEXT>This is the fastest stock production car I have ever driven off the vendor lot and the most fun. I have had Porsches, Ferarri, and various old muscle cars which just do not compare to the overall power plus daily fun to drive performance of this car. I keep reading about plastics, cheap interior, doesn't compare to Porsches, Ferarris, Lambos, etc. Give me a break! It's half the price or less! There is no other car I have owned which comes close to what this car can do for the money spent. This really is the car with the best bang for the buck. I would purchase another if I did not have to wait another 10 months again just to pay premium over MRSP.</TEXT>

Monterey Red with cashmere interior and polished aluminun wheels looks great! I got the 6-speed which is a blast to drive. XM radio with Bose stereo sound great as well.

<TEXT>This is the 23rd Corvette I have owned. I did not trade my Red 2002 Z06 as it only has 6000 miles on it since I bought it new. I like the old hardtop style and I wish the 2007 had the same roofline as the '02. The '07 is way smoother to drive and does not show any kind of raw power until you want it to. I have never had a Corvette like this one. A real sleeper. My wife would never know what it was capable of. It is a pure rocket ship, but much more predictable than the '02, which is a 'twitchy' ride. The new one is so different it's hard to describe. Awesome sound system and navigation system. Rides and steers like it's on railroad tracks and stops instantly. The raw pulling power is brutal!</TEXT>

I glad that I did. After owning it 5 months, I feel that I can say that the ride is smooth,its like driving a regular car. The only options that I order were the chrome wheels,3LT,automatic trans and monterey red. If you really enjoy a well built and fast sports car this is it.

<TEXT>I was not until recently a big Corvette fan. But I have changed my mind after owning the Z06 for the last month. It is the fastest car I have ever driven, even faster than the Lamborghini Gallardo ($200g's) a friend brought by to compare to the Z06. The handling is superb and for normal driving it is very comfortable. Everything about the car says quality. Large multi-piston brakes, advanced electronic traction control, design and attention to detail. The Goodyear Eagle Runflats stick to the road like they are part of it. The gearbox seems a little heavy but I haven't missed a shift and the throw is short and fast. I have never had a car that attracts so much attention. A great car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Flawless paint. Traction control (this is a lot of car to handle with the TC off, but when it's on you feel like a top pro driver) and most of all the 427 small block engine and the sound and power that comes along with it. Acceleration like you can't believe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I was never a Corvette fan, until the arrival of the C6. The new covered head lights, and smaller cleaner looks caught my eye, along with a more reasonable price tag than other cars I was considering. I could not be more happy with this car. It rides better than my friend's Carrera S at half the price. The engine pulls from a 1000 rpm's in any gear. Phenomenol braking and superb handling, and it looks right at home next to Gallardos and F430s. The overall fun for the money factor of this car is unequaled. America has arrived at the party.

<TEXT>I was pleasantly suprised by how good a daily driver this car is. I was expecting the ride to be rough and loud but in fact it is quite liveable. The interior is not quite up to par when compared to a Porsche, but it's good enough. The engine is insane and so above and beyond what you need. There is so much torque availabe even when the revs are are on the low end which makes it alot more flexible their foreign counterparts. Steering isn't quite as nible as I would like but still is quite good. Overall, I enjoy driving this car more than my previous car (996 Porsche).
