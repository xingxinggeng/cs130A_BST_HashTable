<TEXT>I purchased the 2007 DTS Performance used, with 13,000 miles. It replaced a 2003 CTS. WE are very pleased with the handling, quietness, and comfort of the vehicle. The MPG is very positively surprising, particularly when the car plenty of power. THe memory seats are very handy, the controls are simple and well within reach. The Bose sound system is very nice. We've traveled quite a bit in this car this year and we arrive much more relaxed than when in traveling in other cards we've had. Visibility seems poor when backing the car, and the proximity sensors help. Very well pleased with this American car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power and economy, design of car, handling, comfort. The performance series seems to sit up a bit higher. Larger, wider tires, steering.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fun to drive, tighter cabin feel,no gas tank release or lock, no automatic break release, rear trunk area too high, no auto trunk close/lock. Leaves a lot to be desired from the previous years of Cadillac ownership. Driver's seat really squeals with the leather rubbing against the console, rear headliner problems. Navigation is great, so is the Bose sound. Gas mileage is less than my previous DTS by three miles city and 2 miles highway. The higher end, shorter body makes it look more like a sport than a luxury sedan. The vehicle has enough power, but sure sucks up the gas when you, 'step on it'. Nice color coordination on the Mystic Gray ext. and the titanium interior. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, Bose sound, sunroof, power seats, rainsense, remote start, nice rims</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>07 DTS Luxury II ( which is the 08 luxury III) Have owned the performance too. Turn on the Peter White cd. Open the sunroof and drive to another level of comfort. Handles well. People are surprised about the Northstar gas mileage which is excellent for a car over two tons. Excellent crash test ratings. I've bought new before, but this time I went for one that was exactly what I wanted if I had bought new, plus certified gives me another 80,000 miles and 6 years bumper to bumper. ( it is one year old and has 20,000 miles. The beautiful real burled wood is very high gloss. Lots of new equipment to play with. Love the shiny chrome wheels &saved over 25,000 buying it a year old.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Why do "reviewers" think everything on wheels has to be an McClaren? This is a luxury car that is extremely comfortable, reasonably nimble for a 2- ton vehicle, easy to enter and exit, gets me 18+ mpg around town, well made, gives me a back massage, decent appearance. It does what I want it to do in terrific fashion! I'm not sure why a luxury automobile needs 55-series tires, 17 inch wheels, and nearly 300 horsepower, but it does. I've owned a 800 hp street-legal '57 Chevy, I've driven my Dad's Chrysler Hemi for several thousand miles--and they were both great, but I'll take my Caddy for everyday driving. It's solid American iron and I don't think it needs to apologize for anything!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car looks nice enough but interior design needs help, may as well put the radio and A/C panels & controls on the floor since it is necessary to turn & look down to see them. The seat belt buckle is difficult to find jammed up by the center console. The plastic interior is poor quality for a LUX car. The ride is smooth the engine power is good, steering could be tighter. This car rides and handles no better than my base 01 De Ville and lacks the comfort. The controls in the arm rest are poor design resting my arm on it the windows go down and the controls are touchy. There are too many DIC switches. The tire monitor has stopped working. Rear visibility past the rear doors down the side.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cruise control visual set speed, remote lock horn honks only when lock button is p[ressed a second time. Passenger side A/C digital temp read out. Analog insturments with white read out is better than green. Nice large trunk</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall quality, fit, and finish a step up from previous models. Driver door lock switch defective, caused alarm every time car was opened with key. Easily fixed by dealer. Very satisfying car to drive. Under appreciated value for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adaptive speed control and navigation/radio system. Space in back seat and trunk. Lots of stuff to play with.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>How GM can continue to produce garbage like this and still stay in business eludes me. This is the second new Cadillac I've owned, my 04'Deville was a total lemon and I thought it was an anomaly, unfortunately it wasn't, my 07' is an even bigger lemon! I don't know where to start, the car breaks down almost constantly, everything from electrical to drivetrain, even the heated seats broke. The front wheel drive system, axils, seals and transmission are a mess. The car spends more time in the shop than in my garage. If I was to give a complete list of everything that's been repaired on this car it would take an hour to read. About all this car does is look good standing still. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It looks good and that's about all it does.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fake leather dash and door panels, too much plastic, uncomfortable seats. The optional "bench" seats have no lateral support, the seat is too short and does not support my legs, and I cannot find a comfortable position. The passenger seat is similar. Our previous DeVille (2002) had much better seats than this one. The steering wheel is heated but the leather cover does not extend to the 10 and 2 oclock driving areas. Also, the instruments and console are difficult to read while wearing sun glasses (and we really need them in Texas). The luxury options are great, but overall, we're really disappointed with what they've done to this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 5th DTS and it is by far the very best. Black on black. So quiet it's hard to believe! Why someone would not buy or lease this luxury car is beyond me. They have acheived a blend of all that a luxury auto should be in this car. I highly recommend tis wonderful American made automobile. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rich wood grain trim. All displays. Cool seats. Great pickup when you need it! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I took a 2000 mile trip a month after I purchased the vehicle, and I was not impressed with the handling or functioning of the vehicle. Navigation system worked fine there, but, was inoperative on the way back. I was only able to select point-to- point (not selected roads). Stability control allows too much sway on turns (not near as good as my 1995 Eldorado ETC). Icons and Switches: Switches on the Armrest are poorly placed and poorly labeled. Heating and Ventilation: Poor design for the controls. The Air Conditioning blows cold air even when it is 30 degrees outside, and, the car is first started. (The 1995 Eldorado controls were 'Set and Forget'). </TEXT>

<TEXT>The levels of engine and road noise are still excessive in the current DTS, especially when compared to the Town Car, Mercedes Benz, and Lexus models. There is still too much NVH feedback through the steering wheel. A couple of times, when making a sharp U-turn, it felt as if the drive belt slipped resulting in the temporary failure of the power steering. Another annoyance is a squeak caused by the front seat back rubbing against the stationary center armrest console when encountering bumps. Get the bench seat option if you hate squeaks. Cadillac knows of the problem since the side of the seat bottom cushion contacting the console is covered in fabric. I will consider another DTS in '09.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dealer actually found me one in my favorite decades-old Cotillion White (now supposedly offered only with the livery package) with Shale leather. Excellent sound system. Nicely cooled seats on hot days, though the seat back should also include cooling--probably won't use the seat heating feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We rented one of these babys in Hawaii. Trust me, this is definitely a car that anyone should show up in to any sort of party or get together. Plenty of power; sounds like a muscle car when revved, lots of get up and go, and extremely quiet. Handles decently as well for a car 9 ft. longer than a Lexus LS 460. It is more the experience of driving one (as would be driving something like a Lincoln Town Car) more than actually owning it. If you need seating for 6 and something old and stylin', go for it! Way too overpriced though for some of the idiosyncracies is has; just pick up a used one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first ever Cadillac and have been driving for 40 years. It amazes me there are not more DTSs sold. The ride, comfort, and feeling of security makes me wish I had purchased a Cadillac before this.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving the new DTS is the most user friendly experience ever. It does for luxury what the '07 Corvette does for performance. You don't have to spend a fortune to have the best ride on the road - this car looks great and gives the passengers a feeling of safety and comfort that is top level and impressive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>How easy it is to get in and out of the front and back. It is all just right.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car rides and handles much better than I expected. For its size, comfort, and economical operations I cannot think of a better choice. I use the car to transport customers on trips between 10 miles to over 100 miles. I always hear comments like "how come they don't sell more of these." I am never ashamed to use this vehicle with my clients.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride, the comfort and the look. I love the XM radio and the direct connect for my iPod. It has great leg room, head room and a large trunk.</FAVORITE>
