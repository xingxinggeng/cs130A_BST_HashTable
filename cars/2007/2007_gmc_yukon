<TEXT>traded in my 2001 yukon sle 4x4 (170,000 mi) for the 2007 yukon sle 4x4 (32,000 mi). I am a bit disappointed and wish for the old 2001. Miss the heated side mirrors, and have a different rear end gear. I get better highway mileage, but worse towing mileage. Have not had it in the mountains/snow yet, the front end has a nasty bounce when going over speed bumps and on the highway over irregular road surfaces (dealership cant find anything wrong).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the computer info from the dash, (tire pressure readout, mpg, miles left of fuel, etc). 3rd row seats are easier to remove/install. 8/4 cylinder control is neet.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched and drove and five different SUV's prior to purchasing the Denali. I am real estate and it helps to sit up high to look at property. The vehicle is nicely appointed and comfortable. Plenty of pick-up for merging and passing on the highway. The captain chairs in the middle row sealed the deal for me. My business partner is 6-8' and fits comfortably in the middle seat. I would recommend this vehicle to prospective purchaser. Only problem I have had is with the exterior door handles and the dealership replaced them at no cost. Definitely worth paying a little more compared to Tahoe/Yukon. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle in Sept of 06 and thought it was going to be the best purchase ever. I have only had problems with this Yukon since the day I bought it. Problems with the battery, heater, arm rests and more. I was so disappointed as the vehicle looks sooo nice on the outside. Inside is great, lots of room...but poorly made with cheap parts. Time to move onto something else. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look of the Exterior. Very Sharp looking. Have always loved that.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a 2007 Yukon SLE that I really like, EXCEPT...I drive on some dirt roads and it is impossible to keep the dirt from packing onto the back window. Driving in snow also results in snow PACKING on the rear window. If you don't start the rear wiper early on, you can't keep the snow off the window. I feel it is a dangerous design and I am trading off my Yukon, despite how much I like the darn thing, for a vehicle with a different spoiler (for lack of a better word) above the rear window. That is what causes the problem. I had a 2003 Tahoe that didn't have this spoiler and the dirt and snow on the window was minimal. Talk to a car wash place, they'll tell you exactly what I am talking about</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's a great vehicle; has a lot of convenient things. Fuel mileage is as good as any SUV, even the smaller ones.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this Denali for my wife. She can haul around groceries, our two children, and their friends. When gas was $4.00 / gallon, her father asked what we got for fuel economy, I asked him how do you equate fuel economy with safety for your daughter and grandchilren? He didn't get it. Once you drive the Denali, you will. For the record, we get 13.5 mpg around town and averaged 18+ mpg on a 2000 trip. I think the fit and finish could be a little better, but overall, I wouldn't trade this truck for anything.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle with 30,000 miles for 30k. I was a bit skeptical to purchase as I have been loyal to the Japanese as of late (150k on my Nissan and 100k on my Toyota with no problems). I looked at every vehicle possible including the mid size MDX and X5. For me it came down to two different issues. #1, We have two children and I wanted a vehicle that would allow easy access to the 3rd row. #2, after great debate with my wife, I didn't want to drive anything that looked like a "little girls car". I'm still under the factory warranty and have had a couple items fixed. If this vehicle holds up I will support GM in the future! Poor gas milage is expected in a vehicle this size, 14mpg!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, remote start, power side mirrors, performance (390hp), On- Star and safety features make me feel that my family is safe!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's surprising how poorly GM designed the 2007 Yukon. By now, you'd think that they would understand that it's unacceptable to have panels and wipers falling off the the truck... to the tune of several hundreds of dollars of unexpected expenses! Interior packaging is just OK... difficult to get kids in and out of the vehicle, even a vehilce of this size.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the Yukon Denali in May of 2006. The truck rides great. The interior is roomy, the leather & components are sturdy & well built. My traction control light comes on occasionally but go off within minutes. The only major issue Ive had was a switch went out in the transmission causing the car to not recognize neutral & sometimes not go into reverse. This was fixed under warranty & has been problem free for the last year. One great thing is the saftey issue. My car was broad sided by a car running a light at 30 mph. The car was damged but barly felt it. The blue green color looks great changing color in the sun but shows all finger prints & dirt. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6.2 gives plenty of power & pick up. Very sturdy & safe. Handles great for a SUV. Leather wears well. Heated steering wheel odd but nice touch. Navigation reliable. Power lift gate, remote start very nice. Power folding middle seats great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a truck. I traded in a 2004 Toureg V8 fully loaded for this Denali. Plenty of power, comfort, and style! I was very impressed with the car when we took it for a test drive and continue to be impressed with it 11 months later. Good build quality and I do enjoy that big 6.2 liter V8 rumble when you start it. Great truck for long trips.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very nice vehicle. I love to drive this and it has a lot of power, and has good handling. The 10 Bose speakers are really good. We checked out the Tahoe, Armada, X5, Escalade, and Pathfinder, and this had more power (except Escalade) than the rest of them and better fuel economy. This also has power running boards that people really look at. Very comfortable 4 captain heated seats. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this 07 Denali, would have rather had a Tahoe, I think better styling. But love this Denali, fun to drive, comfortable, great turning radius. As most have mentioned could be better MPG, but for it's size not bad, 16-18. But I have to bite the bullet and drive this size vehicle due to bad knees, back, ankles, so need this size and would absolutely buy another. One of best vehicles I have ever had, no problems. The vehicle and dealers service dept. are better than sales dept. Wouldn't buy from this dealer again. Great in winter in MN, now have 35,000 on it no problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After coming from a BMW X5 pile of junk, this Yukon is a dream come true. Very comfortable to drive, pleanty of power, love the xm & navigation with back up camera.

<TEXT>I searched for one year to find a used one that had eveything that I wanted. Ended up with a fully loaded SLT with back up camera and power everything. I was not dissappointed. I looked at several luxury brands and none compared as far as space and quality of ride. We do a lot of trips from 200 to 500 miles and we rode in absolute comfort. Gas mileage isn't that bad for size of the truck. Visually appealing lots of second looks .</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving a mini-van for quite awhile, I was so excited about driving a truck again! In shopping around, we narrowed our choices down to the Yukon, Tahoe, and Armada. Fortunely, we fell upon a rebate that we just couldn't resist on the Yukon! I Love it! It has worked out very well for my children as well. There is plenty of elbow room for them. The rear A/C has been a lifesaver in our Texas heat! It runs smoothly, looks great, and gives us a secure feeling that we are well protected. The gas mileage could be better but we knew that when we bought it. The stereo is great and the instrument panel is well designed. OnStar, XM radio, and remote controls are wonderful. I highly recommend it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>When grocery shopping, the remote control comes in very handy. The interior design is classy and convenient. Rear A/C is a must have!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned several Suburbans in the past; as we became empty nesters I figured that I didn't need such a large vehicle. We downsized for a while, (tried a Jeep) but finally decided that we really enjoyed the larger size of the Yukons. I've had this vehicle for a year now, put on about 13,000 miles and am rather impressed. Almost no issues; the only problem I've experienced is that the power liftgate does not function consistently when the temp drops below zero (I'm in Minnesota) - but then neither do I. Fit, finish, comfort excellent - smooth vehicle for an SUV. No funny noises, except for an AC belt that occasionaly chirped until it was adjusted.</TEXT>

After purchasing turn x turn directions, I learned that the sattellite was not working in my area. They just kept my money until I brought it up after asking for directions and receiving the new of not having sattellite coverage in my area. I tried made in the USA, and I lived to regret it.

I could not be happier with my choice, I got the Sealth Gray Met. w/Ebony Int. and the DVD system. the fit and finish on this truck is light years ahead of my 02' truck and even the 06'Yukon. I only took the for GM to almost go out of business before they allowed the designers to ready get it right this time.

<TEXT>This is my 4th new GMC truck in as many years. GMC has some work left to do on this one, with some areas that greatly need improving. The entire drivetrain needs refinement. The engine has decent power, but the transmission is horrible. Compared to the Allison in my last diesel, this 6 speed GM made transmission is junk. It is not happy in any gear but reverse, and is confused the rest of the time. It is geared too tall. Same with the fly-by-wire throttle. It is as unpredictable as the one in the ill famed Audi 5000S. The cheap plastic on the interior is horrible. It is the same poor quality stuff they put in all low end GM's. Very bad for a $55k SUV. Never again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Strong motor (why only 380hp in the GMC vs 403hp in the Escalade? Perhaps a marketing ploy to differentiate the Escalade?), great looks (except headlights), decent electronics (no iPod control?), nice leather seats (could be a bit softer), good towing capacity. Flexible seating arrangement.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought one of the first 2007 Yukons when they became available in 2006, and over the last 18 months I've put 28,000 miles on it. It's a marvelous vehicle to drive. It's fun, powerful and easy to steer, and the tight turning radius is extremely helpful in crowded parking lots. The XM radio is better than I thought it would be, and the power-assisted lift gate is actually very useful, addictive almost. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that can afford to fuel it. In stop and go city driving, you're looking at 10 or 11 mpg (on a good day). For extended highway driving, it is entirely possible to get 18-22 mpg, but the average will be 17-18 mpg</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats (1st and 2nd rows!), comfortable driver's seat, good interior controls, fun to drive, nice heavy 3 ton weight lets you know that you have nothing to fear from stupid teenagers driving their Prius too fast.</FAVORITE>

Large space, powerful engine and nice Boss sounds. Very nice mix mpg, highway, local plus traffics, 16MPG, same as my friend's Nissan Xterra. but some bugs are annoying me, engine light is always on since the second day after I take it home.

<TEXT>Keep in mind I am new to American cars. I bought this car because I wanted something comfortable with 3 row seating. For some reason I got so taken in by how comfortable it was driving the car that I forgot to even check the other rows, which I normally do when checking a car. I love how comfortable it is, nice, big, and seats 8...well that's what I thought. I guess after looking at the Sequioa and the Armada I thought it was safe to assume that the 3rd row had more than enough room...think again. Maybe the fact that I am 5'8" doesn't help, but I would expect for there to be room for me in the 3rd row. Overall the car is what it is, but for such a pricy American car I expected more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 99 Denali, then switched to the Envoy and Envoy XL for a few years. When I saw the 07 Yukon, I knew I had to have it. My wife wouldn't let me get the Denali(cost), but I have enough features on the one I got, so I'm not complaining. The big selling point was the fuel management system (V8/V4 auto switching). I get the same MPG as I did with my V6 Envoy XL. This the best Yukon yet! I can't even imagine how nice the Denali must be. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After six months of driving and 21,000 miles, I have gotten to know the service staff at the dealership on a first-name basis. They have fixed loose moldings on the rear doors, worked on air conditioner twice (without the problem being fixed), turned the front rotors, and fixed a broken arm on a rear seat. When not in shop, it performs well. Gas mileage is in the 21 - 22 mph on the Interstate. It pulls a 19 foot bass boat with ease and is very comfortable.

<TEXT>I just returned from a 5,361 mile trip, and could not be happier with my GMC. Averaged 20-22 mpg on the highway...except for the Interstate in West Texas which as an 80 mph speed limit, and I was pushing it to get home after 40 days away from home. I constantly had people complimenting my GMC, and commenting how much better looking it is than the Tahoe. Driver comfort is excellent, vision is excellent, Bose was excellent, and the constant compliments were very satisfying. The retractible running boards drew rave reviews and everyone said that they did not know they were offered. But, also everyone said that was worth the price for added comfort and ease of entrance and exit of my GMC. GMC has created an excellent SUV that defies the stigma of SUV's. I could not be happier with my investment. Most of all, you feel safer with full length air bags and rising abov" the normal traffic. Great job.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Retractible running boards, autoride suspension, Bose radio, electronic message center/monitor, 360 horsepower engine. Computer monitored fuel system and "flex-fuel" system.

<TEXT>Traded 2003 Expedition for Denali after driving new Expedition, BMW X-5, Acura and Mazda SUVs?. Denali is smooth and by far the most powerful. It is very comfortable on long trips and is easy to drive. I also have a Mercedes S430 and I prefer driving the Denali on long trips. Positives include styling, new interior, comfort of seats, power, and ease of handling. Negatives are lack of fold flat third row seat, folding covers for cup holders and the little storage compartment on center console make the openings smaller than on Tahoe, and they fold the wrong way-making you lift cups over the door. Minor stuff though compared to the great feeling I get when driving this truck. 3500 miles and happy</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I love everything about this vehicle (except my wife complains that she never gets to drive it). The interior improvements over the previous model are incredible. I knew GM could design an interior this well if they put their minds to it. Exterior styling is good, could use a little more uniqueness. However, I still think it's look uplevel (my nephew thinks it's the new Denali). Now have just over 8k miles on the Yukon and gas mileage is OK -- 11-15 city / 15-21 hwy. I switch a lot from E85 to reg unleaded. However, in the last 1k miles, the mileage has greatly improved (coming out of winter doesn't hurt either). A definite good buy.</TEXT>

You feel like king of the road when you are sitting high on the 20" wheels, hit the gas and feel the Denali take off, and listen to the Bose sound system.

<TEXT>A total home run for GM. Five star technology fit and finish. Drove 465 miles to Las Vegas with absolutely no fatigue. GMs value pricing is for real. This is my second '07 Yukon, the first one I bought had a problem, the dealer exchanged it with absolutely no problem. GM has customer satisfaction down! Works great in the snow. Interesting mileage estimates aren?t far off a Jeep Wrangler</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The level of technology and value pricing make this a bonafide winner!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased a Yukon in October, and we love it. We will definitely buy another. In 4 years, we've gone through 15 vehicles between my wife and I, and most of them because she wasn't happy with thier performance. We own a horse farm, and her orignal vehicle was a '99 Yukon. The SUV does great. She has room for all of her things, as well as our two year old's toys and clothes and car seat. She loves to drive it, and when I'm given the option, I like it too. We've taken it on vacation, driven it in the snow, and loved every part of it. It handles better in the snow and ice than our trucks have in the past. Will not hesitate to purchase another. Maybe with more options next time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose sound system, plenty of power, roomy, rides great</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in a 1999 Landcruiser for first GM vehicle. Tentative about leaving Toyota quality, but absolutely love the new Denali. The ride, engine and luxury is everything I wanted. I am glad to see GM step up and delivery a US vehicle that can challenge anything in the market. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quite interior, features, engine, Bose system and 2nd row captain seating. The car handles great and reacts quickly when power is needed. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have over 4,000 miles on my SLT. The comfort and drivability are top quality. On the road mileage is consistantly over 21 mpg when cruise control is used in the 70-75 mph range. There is an issue with a vibration and noise when in V4 mode. My wife loves using it to transport the three grandkids.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, drivability, safety and mileage are tops on our list of favorites. The SLT has horsepower on demand when needed. Mileage has been a pleasant surprise although not up to what is stated on sticker.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We now have over 3,000 miles after 3 weeks and really enjoying the ride. Took a Trip from S. Louisiana to Atlanta and got 18.5 MPG even with the rains and traveling 70-75 mph. The 5.3 V8 with the 3.42 rear end helps with the economy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quit ride, leather heated 12 position seats, smooth transmission shifting, XM radio. I guess all of the new features like watching your engine go from V8 to V4 engine and the instant fuel readings.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Coming from a 2001 Tahoe I was caught off guard. I love to start the truck from inside my house just to hear the boom of the exhaust outside! For a family man this is a hot ride. Numerous features from adjustable petals for my short wife, to the booming bass Bose system when I'm alone. I'm glad I saved my chips and got the Denali over the slade</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav, Bose system, 6 sp tranny,sport shift if you can do it right, OnStar. Torque pushes you into the seat. Rear tv, remote, heated seats front and back, auto liftgate, exhaust when you speed buy sounds like after market!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the Denali! It drives more like a Mercedes M, but smoother. The fit and finish is amazing. The sound (or lack of it) is great! The MSRP on it with Nav, rear ent., sunroof and 20" wheels is $54,500. I paid approx $47,900 ($500 under invoice). </TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been a great truck thus far. The ride and comfort are on par with an Escalade for about $10k less. Plenty of room for my family, especially on long road trips. Some may comment of the gas mileage and say that you should wait for the hybrid version, but by the time you wait, the actual gain/benefits from the hybrid will be small. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded a nice 2002 Sierra for this fully loaded Yukon and what a step up this is. Only had it a couple of weeks and I'm still in awe of just how cool this big SUV is to drive. Took a while to find one with all the goodies without a sunroof (cuts down on head room). Besides, this is Texas. We get in our vehicles to get out of the sun. I'm hoping the gas mileage improves, but I didn't buy a full size SUV thinking it would get 30 MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Totally impressed with the handling. Good power and very responsive steering. Had to drive it on snow and ice before the plates came in and and was completely satisfied. The nav and XM radio have already spoiled me. Love the power rear hatch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first GM product, and so far so good. It's comfortable, smooth, quiet and powerful. The features in the vehicle are vast, and I agree with another Edmunds reviewer that the dealers need to be more aware of the features and their functionality. They were clueless (first time I've actually had to read an owner's manual). Aside from that, I'm very satisfied with the vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav, surround sound system. Overall comfort and fit and finish. Really an impressive vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>BEST BUY EVER</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I got the 2007 Yukon after going thru arbitration on my '05 Envoy. The Envoy had some fatal issues that could not get fixed. The dealer offered a killer deal on the '07 with all the amenities besides NAV. (Which I got on EBAY for half the GMC price) This Yukon turns heads where ever we go. I put some modest 20in rims, and a few chrome items here and there and this Yukon pops. 2007 Yukon has great balance, and drivability for my wife. She does not feel intimidated. Good views all around vehicle, kids love the DVD and I love the NAV, wife loves the Bose system. Power is excellent, thinking about getting the performance muffler from GMC to add a little growl to the mix. Love the color match!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NAV, DVD player, Bose system. Stance of vehicle. Remote start, bucket seats up front. Power. OnStar for accidents. I live in Hawaii so AC is a must and this one keeps us all cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Yukon has exceeded my expectations in most areas save one. The engine idle is the roughest, most annoying setup I have ever experienced. If you aren't moving, the engine idle will pitch and buck the truck giving the sensation of a coffee percolator. Too bad GM refuses to acknowledge the problem. It seems to me that a software upgrade would take care of the problem. That issue aside, this truck handles like a much smaller vehicle. Easy to steer around corners, good sight lines and excellent seating height. Fuel milage has been 16-17 mpg/city and 21-24 mpg/hwy. Pretty good in my book for a 320 hp/V8.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>By far, the XM satellite radio with the Bose speaker system is my favorite feature. Who knew it could make a trip that much easier. The computer information center is also great and has been very useful. Good steering wheel controls for audio and cruise. </FAVORITE>

Day 12, the wipers went off by themselves, and stabilitrak light went off. The wipers wouldn't stop. Turned car off to get gas, messages were gone.

<TEXT>I went back and forth for a month and a half between a Denali and Escalade, decided after figuring the personal prop tax in VA, payment & DP diff., and cost to insure...I saved $180 a month...and the Escalade didnt have the NAV or rear camera or I-pod jack built in, only xenon and airconditioned seats were not. I came out of an Escalade so the step back was hard, but it was a great decision. I bought a black on black, every option for a great lease price. I get all kinds of compliments, the build quality is head and toes above previous models, and the technology is great. Performance is crazy for a 3 ton truck, ride and handling are car like, and visibility is much improved. A+ and its American!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav is the best I have seen, stereo is perfect, auto start is great, rear auto open is handy, and performance is on par with most sports cars at 6.2 0-60. This truck is super quiet and firm, not rattles, squeeks. GMC didnt disapoint even someone as picky as me!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned 5 foreign cars/trucks. 1 VW Jetta in my teens, two BMWs and 2 Range Rovers. My last BMW was just too small for my growing family so we decided on another SUV. We considered the X5, the Armada, the new ML, and the Navigator. After driving all, we were thoroughly impressed with the '07 Denali. To us, by far it was more luxurious than all the others, the ride quality is top of the line, it had ample interior space, and its exterior is quite impressive-and Yukon has an excellent reliability track record. We have black/cashmier, fully loaded with every single option. At least one person does a double take every day I drive it. To spend $50K and not have any remorse says it all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded 2001 Denali for this one ordered in Feb . Has 20 in wheels and loaded with everything but sunroof. I liked the old Denali seats better and ind DIC info center also . I wish you could have 6 cd changer and navigation but I will live with that . 6.2 motor is great and overall is heads above my old Denali. This one GM actually did do right for 95% of it . Mileage 15+ so far which averages about 1 mpg over old before break in . I would recommend these to anyone. Do not need all the chrome wheels and handles , I would prefer black handles and polish wheels but they haev to do what sells. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My last vehicle was an '03 Denali; and with the price increases in gas I was happy to end the lease early to get into the SLT version of the Yukon. The new 5.3 liter engine is at least as fast as the 6.0 liter '03 Denali. I like the fact I'll be able to use E85 fuel when it gets to the Northeast, and the ability to use 4 cylinders at cruising speed is a plus. I'm getting about 1 mile per gallon better now, but feel that will get better as the truck breaks in. The truck is a head turner. I got silver birch with 20" wheels with the Bridgestone tires and it looks great. I love the Navigation radio as I travel thru the bouroughs of NYC, not worring about getting lost. Its a great truck...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I didn't think the power liftgate was going to be a big deal, but I love it. Also, the navigation radio is as good as it gets. I won't be pulling over to the side of the road checking road maps ever again. I still have to get used to the rear view camera, but the infra-red sensors are very helpful.</FAVORITE>

Quiet, smooth and exceptionally agile for such a large SUV. The flex engine works well. I am already getting better MPG than either Tundra.

<TEXT>As a Yukon owner for 6 years, the 2007 Yukon is a striking upgrade. Handling is very solid. Exterior fit and finish are noteworthy. Interior design is intuitive and everything works. I miss the rear "barn doors" of my older version. I appreciate the presence of the air bag curtains. All of the luxury items I sought are combined in this large SUV. Prior to the purchase I drove the BMW X5, the Q-ship and my last test drive was a 2007 Yukon. Exiting the 2007 Yukon, the decision was immediate: 2007 Yukon. </TEXT>

Computer problems I guess, its in now being looked at. Hope this is a one time deal, love the ride, handling, appearance and it is very quiet. Had several GM SUV's, all good, this seems to be best, will see when dealer is done with it and I get several more thousand miles on it. Will do a update at a later time.
